# Pollinate — Delivery Slices & Re-sliced Epic Breakdown

**What changed:** Instead of a single Phase 1 MVP, we're slicing the work into two delivery milestones:

1. **Slice 1: Demo Mode** — Full product works end-to-end for friends & family testing. No paywall. Every feature is free. No money — wallet is a shell, no payments, no tips. Distributed via TestFlight / internal track. Goal: validate the core loop with real users.
2. **Slice 2: Public Launch** — After testing validates the loop, ship to App Store / Play Store with a freemium model. Free tier with limited features, paid tier "Pollinate Plus" ($2.99/month or $29.99/year). Cash App gifting via iMessage links. Monetization layers turn on.

## SLICE 1: DEMO MODE (Friends & Family Testing)

**Goal:** Get the full social-gratitude loop into the hands of 30–100 friends & family. Real gratitude, real journal entries, real seeds blooming, real private hives. No paywall, no subscription, no friction, no money. Validate that people actually use it.

**Distribution:** TestFlight (iOS) + Internal Testing track (Android). Invite-only.

**Duration:** 4–6 weeks of building, then 2–4 weeks of testing.

**Success criteria for graduating from Demo Mode:**

- [ ] 30+ active testers across 3+ groups
- [ ] Daily journal entries per tester/week: 3+ (validates journal sticks)
- [ ] Friends added per tester: 3+ (network formation begins)
- [ ] Entries shared to feed: 20%+ of entries (solo → social bridge works)
- [ ] Seeds planted: 10+ total (time capsule mechanic understood)
- [ ] Seeds bloomed during testing: 5+ (bloom experience lands emotionally)
- [ ] Private hives created: 10+ (validates hero feature)
- [ ] Reviews completed (Trip Down Memory Lane): 5+ (validates review cadence)
- [ ] Hives sealed with 5+ entries and **no send**: 3+ (validates letter-drawer value at zero deliveries — measured via `private_hives.sealed_at`; 2026-08-17 amendment)
- [ ] Packages sent: 5+ (validates package & send flow)
- [ ] Package open rate: 80%+ (validates recipient experience)
- [ ] 7-day retention (unprompted): 30%+ (people come back without being nagged)
- [ ] Seed bloom open rate: 80%+ (bloom notifications drive re-engagement)
- [ ] Qualitative: "Would you send this to a friend?": 70%+ yes
- [ ] Qualitative: NPS: 30+
- [ ] No critical data loss (entries, friendships, seeds, hives): 0 incidents

> ⚠️ **Wallet & money deferred to Slice 2.** The Wallet tab exists as a shell in Slice 1 — showing a "Coming Soon" message. There is **no MDK integration, no funding flows, no tips, no Cash App gifting** in Slice 1. This is intentional: Slice 1 validates the social-gratitude loop (journaling, friendships, seeds, private hives, blooms, feed) **without money**. Cash App gifting, Lightning, tipping, and escrow all move to Slice 2 or later.

### Project 8b: Private Hives (Personal Gratitude Journal FOR Someone)

> **Concept (PRD v3.1):** Private Hives are personal gratitude journals written FOR a specific person. The author writes entries over time — they can ALWAYS see their own entries. Periodically, on a chosen review cadence (monthly, yearly, or manual), the author gets a "Trip Down Memory Lane" — a push notification prompting them to revisit their hive, with entries blooming one by one. The author can also curate entries into a package and send it to a connected friend in-app. The recipient then experiences the entries blooming one by one. Two bloom moments: the author's review and the recipient's package-open.
>
> **This is NOT the old "sealed until bloom date" concept.** The author always has access to their entries. There is no hidden/sealed state for the author.

| #    | Issue                           | Description                                                                                      | Est | Labels                |

| 8b.1 | Private hive model & API        | **The migrations govern, not this row** (amended 2026-08-17 — the columns previously restated here never shipped). Hive shape: `20260815000001` (`private_hives.owner_id`, `private_hives.subject_name`, nullable `private_hives.subject_profile_id`) + `20260815000003` (`private_hives.sealed_at`). Hive entries live in `entries` via nullable `entries.hive_id` — `private_hive_entries` (never in schema). Still to add via new migration (merge-gated per the rule below): `private_hives.review_cadence` (not yet in schema; monthly/yearly/manual), `private_hives.cover_theme` (not yet in schema; 4 values, design language §1). Author ALWAYS has read access. | S   | backend, db           |
| 8b.2 | Create private hive flow (UI)   | Name the person the hive is for. Choose a cover theme. Set review cadence (monthly/yearly/manual). First entry optional at creation. | M   | ios, android, design  |
| 8b.3 | Write entries over time         | Author can add entries to any hive at any time. Author can always see ALL their entries across all hives. No "sealed" state for the author. Entry list view with chronological ordering. | M   | ios, android, backend |
| 8b.4 | Trip Down Memory Lane           | On review cadence (monthly/yearly/manual trigger): push notification prompts author to revisit hive. Entries appear one by one with bloom animation — each entry "blooms" open sequentially. This is the author's bloom moment. | L   | ios, android, backend, design |
| 8b.5 | Seal, then (optionally) Send — **two acts, decoupled** (amended 2026-08-17, per Sage; schema `20260815000003`) | **Seal** is the author's completion act on the hive: select entries into a curated collection, add a personal note, seal the keepsake. Sets `private_hives.sealed_at`. **Requires no recipient** — the grandmother/child/lost-someone hives complete the arc here, and the seal drives WP-2's gold-vs-cream card. **Send** is optional and separate: choose a connected friend, deliver in-app; writes `entries.visibility` `packaged` → `sent`. Sealing must never be gated on picking a recipient. **Send availability is derived, not stored** (ruled 2026-08-17): `private_hives.subject_profile_id` (`20260815000001`, nullable) — null → the subject has no account and "Keep Safe" is the hive's only completion CTA; non-null and connected → Send is offered. `private_hives.sent_to` (never in schema) — hive-level recipient state would cap a hive at one recipient forever, which the per-entry `entries.visibility` model deliberately does not. Mechanism confirmed by Fizz 2026-08-17; recipient read access ruled the same day — see the read-access ruling block below (`private_hives.sent_at` (not yet in schema) + two subject-scoped SELECT policies + one send RPC). | M   | ios, android, backend |
| 8b.6 | Recipient opens package         | Recipient receives notification. Opens package → entries bloom one by one with animation (same bloom sequence as author's review). Slice 1 ending state is a plain Close — react/reply are Slice 1.1, per row 8b.8's ruling (2026-08-17), which owns that deferral. | L   | ios, android, backend, design |
| 8b.7 | Feed event on package send      | Privacy-respecting feed event: "Colin sent gratitude to [Name]" — no contents revealed. Appears in honeycomb feed. | S   | backend, ios, android |
| 8b.8 | ~~Reply after receiving a package~~ **→ Slice 1.1** (ruled 2026-08-17) | Recipient can: react with emoji, reply with a gratitude note, or start their own private hive (inspired by what they received). Cut from Slice 1 — roundtrip mechanics, no new emotion; the inspired-recipient path reuses the 8b.2 creation flow. | S   | ios, android, design, slice-1.1 |

> **Slice 1 ruling (2026-08-17, ratified):** 8b.2–8b.7 ship in Slice 1 — the full arc write → review → **seal** → (send) → open. Build write-and-review first and put it in front of testers the moment it works; then seal → send → open. **Acceptance bar for 8b.4/8b.6: the reveal is pacing, not particle effects.** Entries surface one at a time, dates visible; one tap per memory; the recipient cannot skim. If a tester screenshots it or cries, it passes. If they scroll it like a feed, it fails.
>
> **Send-gate cardinality — RULED: lifetime (Colin, 2026-08-19; flagged 2026-08-17, Sage):** `private_hives.sealed_at` (`20260815000004`, shipped) and `private_hives.sent_at` (read-access ruling below, point 2; not yet in schema) share the same one-directional guard — null → timestamp, once, ever; no unseal/unsend flow. So per hive, every tier gets ≤1 seal and ≤1 send, permanently; a per-hive send figure can't distinguish free from paid. **The ruling: the free tier's "1 hive" is *lifetime* — one hive, ever.** Hives are the sole live counter and the send row is moot: the paywall gates hive *creation* (the `private_hives` insert path), never the seal and never the send — see row 12.5 for the meter. The counter is trustworthy on today's schema: `entries.hive_id`'s FK is `on delete restrict` (`20260815000001`) and `entries_delete_own` refuses deletes inside a sealed hive (`20260815000006`), so a sealed hive is undeletable and `count(private_hives)` can't be laundered back to zero once a hive seals. An unsealed draft can still be cleared and recreated — intended, not a hole: the lifetime bound binds at seal, so nobody is locked out by an abandoned empty draft. **No enforcement exists yet:** `private_hives_insert_own` (`20260815000001`) checks ownership only; building the insert-path gate is row 12.5's work. The former "pending" pricing placeholders in the PRD and Strategy docs are resolved by this ruling (this commit).
>
> **Merge gate (Sage's standing rule, quoted so it doesn't soften):** *"a change carrying a migration and the client code depending on it does not merge until the migration is on production."* Seal work can be written now.
>
> **Enforcement is derived, not enumerated** (amended 2026-08-17, per Sage's correction the same day). This block previously enforced the rule as a list of four versions, `…000003`–`…000006`. The list went stale within hours of being written: the branch added `20260817000002` (unmerged, on `fizz/private-hives-rails` only) carrying `private_hives.cover_theme` — a column `HiveStore.js` already selects and the list never named — so the gate was satisfiable while the app still `400`'d. A merge gate stated as a list of names has to be re-enumerated every time the branch adds a migration; a gate derived from the branch's tip does not.
>
> **The gate:** the branch merges when a sentinel column from its **tip migration** is live on prod — probe it via PostgREST with the anon key; `200` = merge, anything else = hold. Migrations apply in version order, so the tip implies the tail. The sentinel is a column added by the newest file in `supabase/migrations/` on the merging branch, not a pinned commit — a SHA pin rots the moment the branch is rebased (caught 2026-08-17: the previous version of this line cited a commit that a rebase had already orphaned off every ref). Currently, on `fizz/private-hives-rails`, that file is `20260817000002_private_hives_cover_and_cadence.sql` and the sentinel is `private_hives.cover_theme`:
>
> ```sh
> curl -s -o /dev/null -w '%{http_code}\n' \

>   -H "apikey: $ANON" -H "Authorization: Bearer $ANON"
> ```
>
> Premise, stated so it can be attacked: version-order application is sufficient **only if the remote migration history is clean** — prod's earliest schema predates `deploy-migrations.sh` entirely (the script's own header records it). Until `supabase migration list` shows a clean remote history, probe `private_hives.sealed_at` as well and require both `200`s. Instrument: `scripts/prod-schema-check.mjs`, run as `npm run preflight:prod-schema` (Bumble, built 2026-08-17 — PR `9e3711fa…`, branch `bumble/prod-schema-preflight`). Named `prod-schema-check`, not the originally-cited `check-prod-schema`: `run-checks.mjs` enumerates `scripts/check-*.mjs` into `npm test` with no opt-out, and this command must stay out of the test chain. It is a calibrated pre-merge command, not a CI gate; it generalizes this block's single tip-probe to every migration on the branch's disk (an unmapped migration is itself a red), and probes both `cover_theme`-class tip sentinels and `sealed_at` under the same clean-history premise stated above. **Status: built, exit paths verified against prod 2026-08-17; unenforced-by-CI by design — run it by hand before every merge of a migration-carrying branch.** Until the PR merges, the curl above remains the fallback.

> **Recipient read-access ruling (2026-08-17, Lumen — closes the gap Fizz filed and Pixel's §31.6 constraint):** Flipping `entries.visibility` to `'sent'` delivers nothing today: the only SELECT policies on `entries` are `entries_select_own`, `entries_select_via_share` (`20260808000001`), and the restrictive `entries_select_respect_visibility` (`20260813000004`); `private_hives_select_own` is owner-only. The send path (8b.5) ships **one migration** carrying all of the following:
>
> 1. **No new addressing surface.** The audience of a private hive is its subject — singular by product definition — and `private_hives.subject_profile_id` (`20260815000001`) already names them. `'sent'` names a state; the hive it belongs to names the person. `shares` is not a delivery rail and is not reused (no addressee column, UNIQUE `shares.entry_id`, feed-coupled trigger `entries_mark_shared`).
> 2. **One new column: `private_hives.sent_at` (not yet in schema, `timestamptz`)** — the send act's timestamp, mirroring `private_hives.sealed_at`. Not the banned `sent_to`: it stores no address; the address stays derived from `subject_profile_id`. It exists because the recipient's hive-row grant needs a hive-level fact: a `private_hives` policy that subqueries `entries` — whose policies subquery `private_hives` — is the 42P17 recursion class `20260809000004` fixed, and `20260815000002`'s own comment warns of exactly this. Gets the same one-directional immutability guard as `20260815000004` gave `sealed_at`. Per-entry `entries.visibility` remains the only record of *which entries ride in the package*.
>    - Migration hazard: do **not** enforce "sent ⇒ has subject" as a row CHECK over `subject_profile_id` — that FK is `on delete set null`, so the CHECK would make the subject's account deletion fail on any sent hive. The RPC (point 4) enforces it.
> 3. **Two new permissive SELECT policies, both subject-scoped:** `private_hives_select_as_subject` (not yet in schema) — `auth.uid() = subject_profile_id and sent_at is not null`, no subquery; `entries_select_as_hive_subject` (not yet in schema) — `visibility = 'sent' and exists (select 1 from private_hives h where h.id = hive_id and h.subject_profile_id = auth.uid() and h.sent_at is not null)`. Both terms pinned on both sides; the restrictive policy passes because `'sent' <> 'private'`. The reference is one-directional (entries → private_hives, whose policies stay subquery-free), so no recursion.
> 4. **The send act is one SECURITY DEFINER RPC** (`send_hive(hive_id)` shape, not yet in schema; house revoke pattern per `20260813000005`): validates caller = owner, `sealed_at` set, `subject_profile_id` non-null, an accepted connection — then flips the hive's `packaged` entries to `'sent'` and sets `sent_at` in one transaction. Two client-side writes would allow `sent_at` without flipped entries: the recipient opens an empty reveal, the exact failure Slice 1 exists to avoid. **Pricing (superseded 2026-08-19 — D1 lifetime ruling, see the send-gate cardinality block above):** the RPC carries **no paywall check**. The 2026-08-17 ruling ("pricing gates the send, never the seal") settled what pricing could never touch; the lifetime ruling then moved the meter upstream of both acts — the paywall gates hive *creation* at the `private_hives` insert path (row 12.5), and sealing **and sending** stay free and unconditional on every tier. `send_hive` remains the single choke point for send *integrity* (atomic flip + timestamp), not for pricing.
> 5. **Connection is checked at the send act, never at read time.** A delivered keepsake is a gift — a later unfriend does not revoke it.
> 6. **Both directions of the feed/hive coupling close.** Direction one is already closed on `github/main`: `owns_entry()` as replaced by `20260815000001` requires `e.hive_id is null`, and it is `shares_insert_own`'s WITH CHECK (`20260809000004`) — no hive entry can acquire a `shares` row, so the borrow-`shares` delivery route is refused at insert, not merely disciplined. Direction two is still open: `entries_update_own` (live definition `20260815000006`) lets an author move an already-shared entry — live `shares` row — into an unsealed hive, after which `entries_select_via_share` exposes it to every accepted connection and `listFeed`/`listFeedSince` (no `hive_id` filter) render it in the week view. The migration adds the mirror guard: an entry with a `shares` row cannot acquire a `hive_id`. The definer-helper question is measured, not conditional (probe `.scratch/r118-send-path/probe-r118.mjs`, Pixel 2026-08-17, re-run by Lumen the same day against a migration set diffed byte-identical to `github/main`): the inline `not exists` clause on `entries_update_own`'s WITH CHECK refuses with 42501, not `owns_entry`'s 42P17 — no SECURITY DEFINER wrapper needed. Should-pass controls all green: unshared entry still moves into a hive, in-hive edits still work, shared journal edits still work. Gate row lands in `check-share-visibility` with this migration (Pixel writes it).
> 7. **Two shipped comments expire on this migration and must be amended in it** (`comment on` in the same file — teammates quote comments as fact): `20260815000001`'s "nothing here grants that profile any access" and `20260813000004`'s "visibility is a display/state label, not a new grant."
>
> Client note for 8b.6: the package-open header reads the owner's profile; a later unfriend may hide that profile while hive read access persists (point 5), so the mount point needs a fallback for the sender's name.

> **Demo testing tip:** Let testers create private hives with short review cadences (manual trigger or 1-hour monthly simulation) so they experience the full write → review → package → send → open cycle during the testing period.

## SLICE 2: PUBLIC LAUNCH (Freemium + Cash App Gifting)

**Goal:** After demo testing validates the loop, ship to App Store / Play Store with a freemium model. Free tier with limited features; paid tier "Pollinate Plus" unlocks unlimited usage. Cash App gifting via iMessage links enables gratitude-with-money without Pollinate being a money transmitter.

**Prerequisite:** Demo Mode success criteria met (see above).

**Duration:** 3–4 weeks of additional build, then public launch.

---



### Project 15: Cash App Gifting via iMessage (NEW)

> **Concept (PRD v3.1):** Users can attach a Cash App payment link to a gratitude note. Pollinate generates the link and stores the note — it does NOT touch the money. The recipient reads the gratitude note in Pollinate, then taps the Cash App link to claim the payment in Cash App. Pollinate is NOT a money transmitter.

| #    | Issue                          | Description                                                                                                | Est | Labels                |
| ---- | ------------------------------ | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | --- | --------------------- |
| 15.1 | Gift model & API               | `gifts` table: sender_id, recipient_identifier, note_text, cashapp_link, status, created_at. CRUD. Pollinate stores the link reference, NOT the money. | S   | backend, db           |
| 15.2 | Cash App link generation       | Generate Cash App payment links ($cashtag URL format). User specifies amount + recipient $cashtag. Returns a shareable link. | S   | backend               |
| 15.3 | Gift composition screen        | User writes gratitude note, enters Cash App amount + recipient $cashtag, generates link. Note + link stored in Pollinate. | M   | ios, android, design  |
| 15.4 | Share via iMessage / share sheet | Share gratitude note + Cash App link via iMessage extension (iOS) or system share sheet (cross-platform). Recipient receives a link. | L   | ios, android          |
| 15.5 | Recipient opens gift           | Recipient taps link → opens Pollinate → sees gratitude note with bloom animation → taps Cash App link to claim payment in Cash App. | M   | ios, android, design  |
| 15.6 | Wallet tab → Gifting hub       | Replace "Coming Soon" shell with gifting entry point. Show sent/received gifts history. Quick action: "Send a gift." | M   | ios, android, design  |
| 15.7 | Gift feed event                | Privacy-respecting feed event: "Colin sent gratitude to [Name]" (no amounts revealed). Appears in honeycomb feed. | S   | backend, ios, android |


> **Legal note:** Pollinate generates and shares Cash App payment links. It does not custody, transmit, or hold funds. The payment happens entirely within Cash App's infrastructure. This keeps Pollinate out of money transmitter regulations.

| 12.2 | Paywall screen                   | Beautiful paywall: what you get, pricing ($2.99/month or $29.99/year), "Upgrade to Pollinate Plus." Shown when user hits a free-tier limit. | M   | ios, android, design  |
| 12.3 | Freemium free tier               | New users automatically get free tier. No trial period, no card required. Free tier: 1 private hive **ever** (lifetime — ruled by Colin 2026-08-19; see the send-gate cardinality ruling in 8b.5), 1 friend, 1 seed, daily journal (full), yearly review only, full feed access, receive unlimited. Sealing and sending are free on every tier — the hive count is the only hive-side meter. | M   | ios, android, backend |
| 12.4 | Upgrade prompts & limits         | When free user hits a limit (e.g., tries to create 2nd hive, add 2nd friend), show paywall. Free tier remains functional within limits. Soft gates, not hard walls. | M   | backend, ios, android |
| 12.5 | Feature gating logic             | Free = receive unlimited, 1 private hive ever (lifetime, ruled 2026-08-19 — see 12.3), 1 friend, 1 seed, daily journal (full), yearly review only, full feed access. Paid (Pollinate Plus) = unlimited hives, friends, seeds, monthly/yearly/manual reviews, Cash App gifting, premium themes. **The hive gate meters `count(private_hives)` at the insert path — upstream of seal and send. It never meters `send_hive` calls and never reads `private_hives.sealed_at`** (D1, 2026-08-19: the paywall gates hive creation; sealing and sending stay free and unconditional on every tier). The count is meterable because a sealed hive is undeletable (mechanism cited in 8b.5's cardinality ruling); today `private_hives_insert_own` checks ownership only, so this row is where the insert-path check gets built. | S   | backend, ios, android |
| 12.6 | Demo mode → production migration | Flip `demo_mode = false`. Enable paywall. Enable Cash App gifting. Remove demo flags.                                      | S   | backend               |
| 12.7 | Subscription management          | Settings: view plan, manage subscription, cancel, restore purchases.                                                       | S   | ios, android, backend |
| 12.8 | Revenue tracking                 | Track: free → paid conversions, churn, MRR, ARPU, gift attach rate.                                                        | M   | backend, analytics    |


> **Monetization model (decided per PRD v3.1):**
>
> - **Freemium subscription.** Free tier with limited features. Paid tier "Pollinate Plus" at $2.99/month or $29.99/year.
> - **Free tier:** Receive unlimited, 1 private hive ever (lifetime, ruled 2026-08-19 — see 12.3; sealing and sending stay unconditional), 1 friend, 1 seed, daily journal (full), yearly review only, full feed access.
> - **Paid tier (Pollinate Plus):** Unlimited hives, friends, seeds, monthly/yearly/manual reviews, Cash App gifting, premium themes.
> - **Cash App gifting:** Users generate gratitude notes with Cash App payment links, shared via iMessage. Pollinate is NOT a money transmitter — it generates links, doesn't handle funds.

## WHAT COMES AFTER (Future Slices)

After public launch with freemium paywall:

- **Slice 3 (Transaction Fees — IF viable):** MDK/Lightning wallet integration, Lightning funding flows, card onramps. Requires legal counsel to confirm money transmitter status and regulatory compliance. Only proceeds if legal research is favorable. (Projects 3, 4, 5 above.)
- **Slice 4 (Growth):** Collective seeds, pay-it-forward chains, advanced seed types, cash-out flow (if Slice 3 proceeds), feed comments
- **Slice 5 (Moat):** The Garden, Annual Harvest, seed rituals, hexagon state polish
- **Slice 6 (Scale):** Public API, badges, charity flow, Gratitude Pass subscription

## CRITICAL PATH ACROSS BOTH SLICES


| Priority | Issue                      | Why it's critical                                              | Risk                                                      |
| -------- | -------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------- |
| 1        | 1.4 Database setup         | Storage foundation. Blocks all data models including private hives. | Medium — schema design for new private hive models        |
| 2        | 10.1 Tab bar & app shell   | Navigation scaffold. Blocks all UI work. Wallet shell must be in place. | Low — standard tab bar, well-understood             |
| 3        | 8b.1 Private hive model    | Core data model for hero feature. Blocks all private hive work (entries, reviews, packaging). | Medium — new concept, schema design            |
| 4        | 6.3 Hexagon grid component | Most complex frontend component. Blocks Hive UI.               | High — custom layout, dynamic positioning, performance    |
| 5        | 8b.4 / 8b.6 Bloom animations | Emotional payoff of private hives (author review + recipient package-open). Can't ship private hives without it. | Medium — animation complexity, but lower risk than wallet |
| 6        | 12.1 Subscription engine   | Blocks paywall. Can't launch publicly without it.              | Medium — StoreKit/Billing are well-documented             |
| 7        | 15.4 iMessage / share integration | Blocks Cash App gifting. Most complex Slice 2 feature.   | Medium — iMessage extension complexity, cross-platform share sheet |

**Recommendation:** Start database setup (1.4), hexagon grid (6.3), and private hive model (8b.1) on day 1. These are the longest poles. Everything else can flow around them. Bloom animations (8b.4/8b.6) can begin once the private hive data model is in place.
