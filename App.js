// Daily Nudge half A (`PLANS/DAILY_NUDGE_SPEC.md` §4.1) — re-arm the window
// on every foreground. The function itself now lives in
// `src/services/rearmDailyNudge.js` (Account.js's settings row needs it too,
// and this file imports Account.js — see that module's header for why the
// function had to move rather than be imported back).
//
// §4.1's OTHER re-arm — "on every entry save" — is the `onUnlock` handler
// below, and it is not optional now that half B's ask names the condition
// out loud (`NUDGE_ASK_LABEL`, `src/constants/nudgeCopy.js`: "Let me know on
// days my page is still blank"). Without it the consent is factually wrong
// about the one behaviour it describes:
//
//   08:00  resume  -> re-arm; today is unwritten, so today 20:00 is armed
//   09:00  write   -> nothing cancels it
//   20:00          -> the nudge fires on a day they wrote
//
// A written day only leaves the schedule when `reconcile` runs AGAIN, so
// dropping today needs a SECOND resume, after the save and before the hour.
// Write in the morning and don't reopen the app — the most ordinary day this
// app has — and it fires anyway. (This comment previously claimed the
// foreground re-arm "covers the common case" and attributed the save to
// `CoreRitual.js`. Both were wrong: the foreground that PRECEDES a write is
// the one that armed today, and `CoreRitual.js:142` says in its own words
// that it does not save. Sage measured it; a justification comment is a
// dependency, and that one justified nothing.)
//
// The Celebration "yes" handler does NOT go through this function — it has
// no session (`requireUserId` throws) and needs no read, because at that
// beat the user has written exactly today. `src/screens/Onboarding.js` says
// so at the call site. The pre-auth buffer's later flush needs no re-arm
// either: it writes the same day the handler already reconciled against, so
// the window it would compute is the one already scheduled.

// out of this file so check-resolve-initial-route.mjs can exercise it
// without a renderer). Defined in src/constants/demoMode.js, not here —
// CoreRitual.js/HoneycombTab.js/Onboarding.js's demo-only affordances need
// the derived DEMO_CONTENT constant next to it, and importing from App.js
