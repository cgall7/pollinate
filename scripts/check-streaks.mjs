// Gate for the streak/recap defects Pixel and Sage found in thread 19e90cf8
// (2026-08-13): a duplicate same-day entry, and a descending-ordered query,
// both silently collapse `longestStreak`. Sage mutation-tested this file
// (§2-4 of the same thread) and found the gate itself under-tested: the
// duplicate fixtures didn't reproduce the bug they name, the pager fix had
// no coverage at all, and the anchor date was UTC-built while the code
// under test is local-built. Fixed below rather than re-argued.
//
//   npm run check:streaks
//
// WHY ONE ASSERTION INSTEAD OF FIXTURES FOR EACH BUG.
//
// `longestStreak(entries) >= currentStreak(entries)` is true by definition —
// the run you're currently on is one of the runs, so the longest cannot be
// shorter than it. It needs no knowledge of the shape of the defect, which
// is why it caught duplicate-day collapse, descending order, and the
// combination of both from the same line (Sage: "every defect in this post,
// and both of Pixel's, from one line"). A gate built to name each bug only
// proves today's bug is fixed, not that the invariant holds.
