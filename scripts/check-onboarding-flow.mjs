// Gate for One Door — the onboarding rebuild (PLANS/ONBOARDING_ONE_DOOR_SPEC.md,
// Lumen 2026-08-17, amended the same day).
//
//   npm run check:onboarding-flow
//
// WHY THIS EXISTS
//
// One Door collapsed nine screens and two forks into five beats, and added
// the app's first writer for Private Hives. Three of the properties it turns
// on cannot be seen by any existing gate, and two of them are the kind that
// fail silently — nobody watches a buffer not being written.
//
//   C6 (Sage, 2026-08-17). `AccountStep.handleSubmit` has three exits and,
//   before this change, only two of them flushed the buffered first entry.
//   The third — signUp returns no session, the confirm-your-email screen,
//   `onNext` straight to `finish()` — navigated away with the write never
//   performed, and the session-effect flush could not rescue it because it
//   is gated on still being ON the account step. That path is DORMANT, and
//   the thing keeping it dormant is not in this repository: production has
//   `mailer_autoconfirm: true`, a dashboard toggle, no diff, one person.
//   Turning email confirmation on before a public TestFlight arms it.
//
//   So a gate here cannot test the confirm-sent path's behaviour — the
//   condition that reaches it is unreachable from this tree. It asserts the
//   STRUCTURE that makes the path survivable instead.
//
// THE INVARIANT IS "NO EXIT MAY DROP THE BUFFER", NOT "EVERY EXIT MUST
// WRITE IT". That distinction is the whole design. The confirm-sent exit
// deliberately does not write: there is no session, which is the entire
// reason it exists. What makes it safe is that the buffer is DURABLE at
// COLLECTION time and the flush is fired by the SESSION'S ARRIVAL, from
// AuthContext, in whatever process is running when the user follows the
// link. So the three structural facts, each asserted separately:
//
//   (a) both collection sites write through to the durable store;
//   (b) the durable store actually reaches AsyncStorage from both;
//   (c) a flush fires from the session's arrival, outside the screen.
//
// Break any one and the confirm-sent path silently drops an answer again.
//
// WHY THE SPARK REGISTER IS IN HERE. B1–B3 moved into the prompt deck, and
// a spark is never rendered alone — CoreRitual composes it into
// `I am grateful for ${spark}.` So a spark that leads with a capital or a
// preposition lands as broken grammar the user has to repair. Measured over
// the deck before this change: 60/60 lowercase, 0/60 leading preposition —
// an invariant the deck already held and nothing enforced. The twelve new
// sparks arrived violating it 12/12, which is why it is enforced now.
// check-copy-rules cannot see this: it asks whether a word is forbidden,
// not whether a fragment composes.
