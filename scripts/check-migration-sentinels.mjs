// Gate: every migration on disk has a sentinel, and every sentinel has a
// migration on disk.
//
//   npm run check:migration-sentinels
//
// WHY (Sage, 2026-08-17): prod-schema-check.mjs is deliberately outside the
// test chain — it needs network and real credentials CI doesn't have — so
// the one instrument that answers "is prod behind this tree" runs only when
// someone remembers. The event that silently breaks it is purely on disk: a
// branch adds a migration and doesn't map it in SENTINELS. Until this gate,
// the only thing holding that invariant was a coordination note hand-carried
// in two PR bodies. The network probe stays manual; the completeness of its
// enumerator is what goes red here.
//
// BOTH DIRECTIONS, deliberately. A migration without a sentinel makes the
// preflight exit 1 the next time it runs — this gate just moves that red to
// commit time. A sentinel without a migration file is worse: a phantom in
// the probe list reads as a missing deployment and would send someone to
// deploy a migration that does not exist (the calibration-list phantom from
// the 2026-08-17 prod probes, as a standing hazard).
//
// SCOPE OF THE CLAIM. This is an existence check on names, a shape check on
// entries, and a rejection of `order` where the SQL proves a column surface
// exists — it does NOT validate that a sentinel probes the right object
// for its migration's SQL. A sentinel pointing at a column the migration
// never touched is green here and wrong; that half only falls out of running
// the real preflight against prod. Existence is the cheap half, and this
// gate says so rather than pretending otherwise.

// precedes the privilege check (42703 beats 42501), so even an ungranted
// brand-new table is probeable as LIVE. `order` is never the honest kind for

// SQL comments are stripped first so prose ("-- we could add column later")
// cannot red a legitimate order entry. The bare-ADD form excludes the ADD
// variants that create no column (CONSTRAINT / PRIMARY / UNIQUE / CHECK /
// FOREIGN / EXCLUDE) by enumeration; a keyword missing from that list fails
// LOUD — a false red on an order entry — not silent, which is the survivable
// direction for an exception list. Necessary, not sufficient: this rejects a
// demonstrably wrong `order`, it cannot confirm a `column` sentinel points
// at the right column.
