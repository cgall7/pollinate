#!/usr/bin/env node
// Runs every gate in scripts/ and aggregates the results.
//
//   npm test
//
// Why this exists instead of the `&&` chain it replaced:
//
// `npm test` used to be `npm run check:a && npm run check:b && ...`. `&&`
// short-circuits, so the FIRST failing gate silently prevented every gate
// ordered after it from running at all. That is at its worst during exactly
// the window you most need the others: a branch with one deliberately-red
// gate (a fix that lands in a different PR, a rebase not taken yet) reports
// a red `npm test` that looks like it covers the suite, while the gates
// after it never executed. The exit code cannot distinguish "the one gate I
// expected to be red is red" from "eight gates did not run."
//
// Measured on this repo, one real defect injected into the first gate's
// source (a demo member name too long for its hex cell):
//
//   old && chain:  1 gate attempted,  exit 1
//   this runner:   9 gates attempted, 1 red, 8 green, exit 1
//
// Two further properties worth keeping:
//
//   1. It ENUMERATES the gates off disk (`scripts/check-*.mjs`) rather than
//      reading a hardcoded list. A check-list the runner has to be told
//      about has the exact hole a gate exists to close: adding
//      scripts/check-new.mjs and forgetting to wire it up produces a green
//      suite that never ran it. Nothing has to be registered here.
//   2. SKIPPED is its own verdict, not a pass. `SKIP_PG_GATES=1` turns the
//      Postgres-backed gates into no-ops that exit 0; folded into a pass
//      count that reads as "everything green" while three security gates did
//      not run. Skips are counted, named, and flagged separately below.
//   3. A gate that exits 0 having asserted NOTHING is red, not green. This
//      catches a gate going completely dark — most usefully a NEW quiet
//      bail-out path (no database, no fixture, flag off) that exits 0
//      without declaring itself a skip. The contract: every gate prints
//      `N passed, M failed`, and a run of it that asserts nothing is a
//      broken gate, not a passing one.
//   4. A SKIP must be one somebody ASKED for. See the skip rules below.
//
// WHAT THIS RUNNER CANNOT DO, since it is the obvious thing to assume it
// does: it reads each gate's totals, so it cannot see an empty universe
// INSIDE a gate. A gate that enumerates zero tables, or resolves zero call
// sites, and still passes its setup assertions reports `1 passed, 0 failed`
// and is green here — correctly, by the only information this file has.
// Rule 3 fires when a gate asserts nothing AT ALL, which is the rarest way
// an empty LOGIC universe shows up; every real instance in this repo so far
// had a gate with 10-34 assertions and one empty loop inside it.
//
// Completely dark is, however, exactly what an INFRASTRUCTURE failure looks
// like, and infrastructure fails on ordinary days for ordinary reasons — a
// stray process on the embedded-postgres port was enough. On that path rule
// 3 is redundancy and not the first line: a gate that dies exits non-zero
// and `code !== 0` has already caught it. Checked rather than assumed — the
// three PG gates each `process.exit(1)` from their harness catch, and the
// other six are top-level, where a throw exits non-zero on its own. So rule
// 3's real job is the gate whose catch logs and forgets to exit, in a branch
// that by definition only runs on days when something is already wrong.
//
//   >> Therefore, a REQUIREMENT ON GATES that this runner cannot enforce
//   >> for you: an enumerator must assert on its own count before it loops.
//   >> `if (tables.length === 0) bad(...)`. A gate is allowed to be green;
//   >> it is not allowed to be green and empty, and only the gate itself is
//   >> standing anywhere it can tell the difference.
//
// Exit code is 1 if any gate failed, 0 otherwise. Authorised skips do not
// fail the run — the opt-out is deliberate and documented — but they are
// impossible to miss in the summary.
//
// HOW TO READ THAT EXIT CODE, because this repo has now got it wrong three
// times in three different costumes and each one produced a published
// figure that was a different command's status:
//
//   node scripts/x.mjs | tail       -> `$?` is TAIL's status
//   printf '%s %s' "$(basename $1)" "$?"
//                                   -> command substitution expands BEFORE
//                                      `$?`, so the column reports basename
//   the runner's own summary row    -> this file's rendering of what the
//                                      gates said, not a status
//
// The only reading that is the thing itself: run the command, capture `$?`
// on its very next line, and print it on its own. Any figure quoted into a
// review should come from that and say so.

  //     ("materialized view policy check: SKIPPED — no views in schema")
  //     reclassified a gate that asserted five things as "did not run",
  //     while those five assertions still landed in the suite total. The
  //     summary then contradicted itself in one block. A gate that asserted
  //     something is PASS or FAIL on its merits regardless of its prose.
  //
  // (b) Somebody has to have ASKED for it. This is the load-bearing half,
  //     because of how (a) interacts with rule 3: once a skip is defined as
  //     "declared itself empty", the word SKIPPED becomes the one thing a
  //     gate can print to opt ITSELF out of the empty-universe rule and
  //     still exit 0 green. So the skip line has to name an environment
  //     variable that is actually set in this process — which is what the
  //     real opt-out already does ("SKIPPED — SKIP_PG_GATES=1 set
  //     explicitly"). A gate deciding on its own that today it will not run
  //     names nothing, and lands red under rule 3 instead.
  //
  //     Deliberately read out of the message rather than checked against a
  //     list of known opt-out variables here: a list is a registration, and
  //     a runner you have to tell about things has the hole gates exist to
  //     close. The cost is a naming convention — an opt-out has to be called
  //     SKIP_something — which is a rule rather than a registry, and the one
  //     that exists already follows it.
  //
  //     That convention is load-bearing, not decoration. A first draft
  //     accepted ANY all-caps token in the skip line that happened to be a
  //     set variable, and a gate printing "SKIPPED — HOME is not writable"
  //     authorised itself with someone else's environment. Verified as a
  //     real hole before narrowing it, not imagined.
  //     Every line mentioning SKIPPED is scanned, not just the first, and
  //     not only ones prefixed with the gate's name. A gate can satisfy the
  //     SKIP_* convention this contract documents and still print its line
  //     in a shape a tighter pattern misses — and then it lands red for
  //     "empty universe", which is the correct verdict with the wrong

  // assertion failed", and without it the summary prints a bare tally
  // ("0 passed, 0 failed") next to FAIL, which is data and not a diagnosis.
  // The narrow zero/zero case is the one that misleads worst, because it

  // making a catch, when the exit code had already caught it.
