// Gate for how the mascot is held while it flies (Sunbeam §17.3 / §19.5).
//
//   npm run check:bee-attitude
//
// WHY THIS EXISTS
//
// `FlyingBee` used to rotate the bee to its heading with nothing bounding
// the result. Two of the cruise loop's four segments have headings past
// vertical, and the timing easing is symmetric about its midpoint, so the
// bee flew belly-up for exactly half of every loop — live on the Hive, for
// months. Nobody saw it because the bee had no face on it: upside-down
// reads as a loop-the-loop when there is nothing to be upside-down. Colin's
// "our mascot flying through the app, motions pristine" is what makes it a
// defect, and the mascot has a face.
//
// So the invariant this file holds is: **no render path may fly the mascot
// at an attitude you cannot read it at.**
//
// WHAT IT ASSERTS, AND WHY IN THIS ORDER
//
// The rows come in two groups, and the split is the whole design.
//
//   A. THE FUNCTION. `bankFor` is sampled across its entire domain — every
//      half-degree of pitch from -90 to +90 — not at the four pitches the
//      cruise loop happens to fly. This is the correction Sage and I
//      arrived at the hard way, twice in one evening:
//
//        "a clamp exists"            — tautological, a clamp cannot fail
//        "rotateOutput within ±22"   — PASSES a saturated clamp perfectly.
//                                      Every live cruise pitch exceeds 22,
//                                      so clamp(±22) emits two latching
//                                      values and the row stays green.
//        "±22 holds by construction" — unfalsifiable a third time, because
//                                      the new formula makes it true of
//                                      any input at all.
//
//      Each replacement was a gate that could not fail on the configuration
//      it was written to police. The escape is to stop asking the *tracks*
//      about the *formula*: four sampled points cannot pin a function, and
//      the function is importable, so sample the function. A clamp
//      reintroduced anywhere in the domain shows up as a flat step; a
//      constant, a latch and a sign inversion all die on the same rows.
//
//   B. THE TRACKS. Everything that depends on a real path in a real box:
//      the rendered bank at every interpolation node, the facing rule, the
//      turn's wall-clock length, the loop seam.
//
//      Every row here names the container it was measured in, because that
//      is the error that produced this file. A fractional coordinate is not
//      a position until you name the box, and *the call site names the box*
//      — `loginArc` is flown inside a 220x100 wordmark anchor, not the
//      screen, and both reviewers resolved it against 393x852 and got a
//      figure that was wrong by 2x. Screen-mounted sites are therefore
//      evaluated on four device boxes, not one, so no row can pass by
//      being measured on a convenient phone.
//
//   C. COMPLETENESS. An unlisted `<FlyingBee>` call site is a FAILURE, not
//      a skip. The call sites are enumerated from disk; the containers are
//      declared here with a reason, because "what box is this mounted in"
//      is a question a human has to answer — but a declared box that can be
//      read back from a stylesheet IS read back and compared. That row is
//      the one that would have caught tonight.
//
// WHAT THIS GATE CANNOT DO. It models the easings by name: it recognises
// the two expressions `FlyingBee.js` actually uses and reimplements them.
// A third easing is a FAILURE here, not a silent pass — a gate that cannot
// tell must not look like a gate that has no objection.

// gate above holds the mascot at a readable attitude and says nothing about
// whether the thing being held is the mascot.
//
// The obvious shape is an exemption list: no bee but the mascot, *unless*
// declared here with a reason. I am not writing that, and the reason is a
// rule I have been on the wrong side of before — **an `unless` clause is
// self-issued unless you check who granted it.** A list of permitted
// exceptions is a place for the next exception to go, and the register that
// was going to be its first entry (the keepsake, ink-on-gold, which a raster
// cannot recolour) turned out not to need one: the mascot inverts which
// element carries the form, so undoing that inversion *is* the knockout.
// R83. Both registers are now the same drawing, so the exemption list would
// have been an empty list with a door in it.
//
// So the rule is enforced by absence. There is one drawing of the bee, it
// ships as `mascot-*.png`, and the component that drew the other one does not
// exist. A gate cannot check that a PNG is on-brand, but it can check that no

  //    "Is this the mascot" is answered by REACHABILITY, not by a list. The
  //    two components that draw `mascot-*.png` seed the set; anything whose
  //    own file renders a member joins it, to a fixpoint. So a wrapper that
  //    adds a rhythm to the mascot (`WelcomeBee`, the 132pt held pose) passes
  //    by construction, and a new bee that draws its own shapes fails by
  //    construction — neither needs an entry anywhere.
  //
  //    A hardcoded permitted-set is the version of this row that has the hole
  //    it exists to close: the first draft was one, and adding `WelcomeBee` to
  //    it by hand is exactly the edit that makes the next bee's entry routine.
  //
  //    TWO CORRECTIONS, both found by mutating this row rather than reading it:
  //
  //    (a) The seeds were the hardcoded pair `MascotBee`/`KeepsakeBee` — the
  //        same list one level down, since a third register would have to be
  //        added by hand. A seed is now anything that `require`s an
  //        `assets/mascot-*.png`, so a register that draws the shipped asset
  //        joins on its own and one that draws a *different* asset does not.
  //
  //    (b) Membership was EXISTENTIAL where the rule is UNIVERSAL: "renders a
  //        mascot somewhere in its file." A component that draws its own bee
  //        on one branch and delegates to `MascotBee` on another satisfied
  //        that and passed — verified, it goes green. And that is not a
  //        hypothetical shape: it is `WelcomeBee` as it stood this morning,
  //        one `<MascotBee>` away from being invisible to the row written to
  //        find it. So a wrapper joins only if it renders a member AND draws
  //        no vectors of its own. Scope stated plainly: "draws its own" means
  //        it imports `react-native-svg`, which is how every bee this project

// held. That is sound only if the box can move by nothing but a layout pass,
// and it can: `onLayout` is emitted from `affectedLayoutableNodes`
// (`ShadowTree.cpp:571-574`), which is filled only under
// `getHasNewLayout()` (`YogaLayoutableShadowNode.cpp:701`), and Yoga does not
// handle transforms at all (`YGNode.h:279`). A container moved by an ancestor
// transform leaves the cached origin stale, silently, by an amount with no
// sign to spot it by.

// So the row asserts the TRIGGER, not the call: `measureInWindow` was already
// in the file — it was simply invoked from the one event a transform does not
// produce. F3 below has the same shape of history and it is worth stating the

// NAMES the live ref and nothing asked whether the ref was LIVE; this asks
// whether the origin is measured, and the thing that must be checked is WHEN.

// What it does not cover, stated so nobody reads coverage into it: a
// natively-driven ancestor transform is invisible to `measureInWindow` too

// writes the layer directly, `RCTMountingManager.mm:316-324`; measured, 18
// samples of y = 0 while the view slid 200pt). Measure-on-use widens the

// wherever the visit began.
//
// §32.2 SPLIT THIS ROW'S SUBJECT AND THE ROW CAUGHT IT — correctly, and as a
// false red, which is the more useful of the two outcomes to write down. The
// sequencer solves its dwell against `sortieDurationFor(hop)`, which calls
// `buildPollinationPlan` with a SYNTHETIC `from` of the origin and a target
// one hop away, purely to ask how long that flight would take. That call is
// not a flight and must not read `posRef`: it is measuring a distance, and
// seeding it from wherever the bee happens to be would make the solved dwell
// depend on where he was standing when the anchors last changed.
//
// So the row now classifies by USE rather than by callee, which is the honest
// question anyway: A CALL THAT PRODUCES A PLAN MUST START WHERE THE BEE IS; A

// used ONE radius off the lattice step, so the ×0.72 alternation was doing two
// jobs — variety AND clearance — and the short flecks were, by arithmetic, the
// ones that failed: measured on device, the 48-degree fleck never left him.
//
// **The invariant is stated on the currency a viewer has, not on position.**
// The first form of this rule bound each fleck's TERMINAL position, which is
// the frame its opacity reaches zero — satisfiable by a fleck nobody ever sees
// outside him. What ships: every fleck is clear of the DRAWN silhouette while
// at least half its seed opacity remains.
//
// That instant is exactly u = 0.5 and the row does not have to evaluate a
// bezier to know it. Opacity runs `Animated.timing`'s default easing,
// `Easing.inOut(Easing.ease)` (`TimingAnimation.js:77`), and `inOut(f)(0.5)`
// is `1 - f(1)/2`; `f(1) = 1` is what makes `f` an easing, so the half-opacity
// instant is 0.5 for ANY inOut curve. The two curves that DO matter are named
// and evaluated: drift is `Easing.out(Easing.cubic)` (0.875 at u = 0.5) and
// the dot's own radius shrinks on the same default inOut (0.65 of 3pt).
//
// R81's rule, one beat over: SAMPLE THE FUNCTION, NOT THE FLIGHT. The live

// MEASURED, not recited, because the familiar claim about this prop does not
// hold on the installed version. `scrollEventThrottle={16}` is INERT here:
//
//   • Fabric — `BaseScrollViewProps.h:57` defaults it to 0;
//     `RCTScrollViewComponentView.mm:381-388` maps any value ≤ 1/60 s to an
//     internal 0, and `:744` then dispatches whenever `now - last > 0`. 16
//     and absent produce the identical internal value.
//   • Old arch — `RCTScrollView.m:385` defaults it to 0 and `:716` tests
//     `_scrollEventThrottle < MAX(0.017, elapsed)`, true for both 0 and
//     0.016. (The TODO at `:708` says 0 means "once per scroll"; the code
//     under it has not done that for some time. The comment is stale.)
//   • Android — `ReactScrollView.java:1620` stores it and
//     `getScrollEventThrottle()` has NO reader anywhere under
//     `ReactAndroid/src/main/java`. Probe scope stated: that directory, that
//     method name.
//
// THE FOLK CLAIM ABOUT THIS PROP IS WRITTEN DOWN TWICE AND IMPLEMENTED ZERO
// TIMES. `RCTScrollView.m:708` (a TODO) and `RCTScrollViewComponentView.mm:378`
// ("Zero means 'send value only once per significant logical event'") say the
// same false thing, in two architectures, and the second is a from-scratch
// reimplementation that carried the sentence forward — contradicted by `:744`,
// eleven lines below it. So the usual tell for a stale comment (one file
// disagreeing with everything else) is unavailable: a reader who distrusts one
// and checks the other finds corroboration.
//
// And the third source is the one that makes the bound below defensible.
// `ScrollView.js:580-583` and `ScrollView.d.ts` — the only two a JS developer
// reads — are CORRECT and SILENT: "Values <= `16` will disable throttling,
// regardless of the refresh rate of the device", with no statement of the
// default. THE DOCUMENTED SURFACE IS SILENT EXACTLY WHERE THE BEHAVIOUR IS
// SURPRISING, WHICH IS WHAT LETS A FALSE COMMENT IN THE IMPLEMENTATION READ AS
// AUTHORITATIVE.
//
// So the row does not assert the PROP, which would be asserting a token that
// governs nothing on this version. It asserts the PROPERTY: absent is fine,
// present must be ≤ 16 — and that 16 is the DOCUMENTED GUARANTEE, not the
// implementation constant (Fabric's internal threshold is 1/60 s = 16.67ms;
// binding the row to the documented number is what keeps it true if the
// implementation moves inside its own promise). The value stays in the source
// anyway, because a default of 0 meaning "every frame" is behaviour this beat

// F3 above asserts that both plan builders take waypoint 0 from

// life of this beat, while `posRef` held `{ x: 0, y: 0 }` from mount to
// unmount and every flight began in the container's top-left corner. The row
// was not wrong; it was answering a question one layer above the defect. It
// asked whether the source NAMES the live ref. Nothing asked whether the ref
// is live.
//
// The mechanism, verified in the installed RN (0.86.2) and then on device:
//
//   • `AnimatedWithChildren.__callListeners` (`:72-84`) calls the node's own
//     listeners, then cascades to children ONLY `if (!this.__isNative)`.
//   • `__makeNative` (`:24-39`) walks DOWN the chain, so once a value is
//     driven natively every node derived from it is native too.
//
//   ⇒ a listener on `t.interpolate(...)` is registered and then never called.
//     Measured: 49 callbacks in 800ms on the value; 0 on an interpolation of
//     it, whether or not that interpolation is attached to a real transform.
//     The class of the derived node is irrelevant, so "listen on the pair the
//     render uses" — the obvious fix — is also dead.
//
// The guard is correct, not a bug: under the native driver JS has no fresh
// value for the children, and RN chose frozen over stale. Frozen is also what
// made this findable, since a bee that teleports to the corner is a bug report
// and a bee lagging its own trail by two frames is not.
//
// So the rows below are about the SHAPE of a subscription, which is the part
// that is statically decidable. They cannot prove a listener fires — only a
// device can, and one did. What they can do is make the dead shape impossible
// to reintroduce, in this file or any other.

//
//   * the ROOT stack (`App.js`, `@react-navigation/stack`). Its unfocused card
//     carries `translateUnfocused`, 0 -> `screen.width * -0.3`
//     (`CardStyleInterpolators.tsx:29-37`), driven with
//     `useNativeDriver: Platform.OS !== 'web'` (`Card.tsx:79`, `:251`). That is
//     UNCONDITIONAL and is what a stack is for — not gateable, and recorded in
//     §28.11 with its bound instead.
//   * this one, `MainTabs.js`. `hasAnimation` gates the whole tab transition on
//     `options.animation` / `options.transitionSpec`
//     (`BottomTabView.tsx:60-67`), and neither is set — so today there is no

//     the root stack's identical mechanism is only worth writing down.
//
// It asserts the BOUND, not the token. `animation: 'fade'` is opacity-only and
// cannot move this box; `'shift'` carries `translateX` ±50. A row that reds on
// both would be red about something it has no opinion on, and rows that fail
// correct trees teach people to edit the gate. So the row resolves the name

//     driven node is frozen at its first commit ---------------------------
//
// Section H made `posRef` live, so the flight starts where the bee is. The
// particles it drops did not: every trail dot and every pollen fleck in the
// app rendered at the container's top-left corner, for as long as the pool
// has existed. Measured on device, 20 frames of ambient cruise: one 6.0 x 6.0
// pt `accentBurst` square at (2.8, 2.8) pt in 20 of 20 frames, and not one
// particle anywhere near the bee. The named glow of §17.3 R51 and the pollen
// of §20.7 have never been on a screen.
//
// The cause is two deliberate steps in RN 0.86.2, both measured in the
// running app rather than read:
//
//   1. `createAnimatedPropsMemoHook.js:162-189` builds the memo key that
//      decides whether to rebuild an `AnimatedProps` node from `AnimatedNode`
//      instances ONLY. A plain number becomes `null` in that key. Two styles
//      differing only in `translateX` (0 -> 211) compare
//      `areCompositeKeysEqual === true`, so the node is reused, forever.
//   2. `AnimatedTransform.js:147-156` bakes every non-node entry into the
//      native config as `{type: 'static', value}`. That config is generated
//      once, when the node goes native. Measured on a pool slot:
//      `{"type":"static","property":"translateX","value":0}`.
//
// The JS render path is fine — `__getValueWithStaticTransforms` reads the
// FRESH array every render — which is exactly why a state dump of the pool
// showed twelve correctly positioned particles while the screen showed one
// stack of them in the corner. The model was right. Only the native side was
// stale, and the native side is what you see.
//
// R89's shape, one layer over, and with the same tell: the initialiser
// happened to be the correct value at the only place anyone looked.
//
// WHAT THESE ROWS DO NOT CLAIM. A non-node entry is not a defect — it is a
// CONSTANT, and a constant baked once is correct. Whether a given expression
// is constant for the life of a mount is not decidable here, so I1 asserts
// only the part that is: an entry the file itself can be seen to CHANGE.
// The sites that are constant today by call-site coincidence rather than by
// construction (`MascotBee.js:94`'s hinge offsets, derived from a `size`
// prop no caller currently varies) are named in §28.13 instead, because a
// row that fails a correct tree is a row people learn to edit.

//    row that matters most cannot be written until a host declares one, and it
//    is the row that turns this from a property of the engine into a property
//    of the app."
//
// A host declares one now. Section J proves things about `chooseAnchor` for
// synthetic anchor sets swept over n and depth; this section proves the sets
// the app actually ships are ones J's conclusions apply to. Neither is
// redundant and the split is Sage's §4 rule: J asserts a property of what it
// can import, K goes to the call sites it couldn't.
//
// The anchors are read out of the JSX rather than out of a table, because the
// table was the defect. Deezine's guide carried a per-state anchor count,
// Sage found it wrong within the hour (it counted affordances against a rule
// written in structural terms and missed the footer), and both of us then
// published corrections to a document nothing checks. `<PerchAnchor>` makes

// they enumerate `PerchAnchor` nodes and measure them. So they are blind in
// exactly one direction: a screen that grows a new top-level region carrying
// no anchor stays green, because the thing that is missing is the thing the
// collector enumerates. `fizz/private-hives-rails` adds an unconditional
// `<StaggeredItem index={3}>` shelf to TodayTab with no anchor in it; the
// merge is one trivial conflict hunk in the `useState` block, so the half
// that needs a decision is the half git resolves silently.
//
// A GATE THAT ENUMERATES X CANNOT SEE A MISSING X. So this row asserts the
// direction the others cannot:
//
//   every top-level `StaggeredItem` on a screen that declares a perch set
//   is contained by a `PerchAnchor`, or contains one that renders in EVERY
//   state the step itself renders in.
//
// That last clause is not decoration — see `anchorsInEveryState` below for
// the green-and-wrong shape it exists to catch.
//
// ONE DIRECTION, NOT A BIJECTION, and the difference is not a detail. The
// obvious reading is Bumble's `check-migration-sentinels` shape, which
// checks both ways — but he needs both because his sentinel table is a
// SECOND COPY of the migration list, and either copy can drift. The anchor
// set is not a copy of anything; `PerchAnchor.js`'s header says it outright
// ("THE ANCHOR SET IS NOT A TABLE, IT IS THE RENDER TREE"). An anchor for a
// region that does not render cannot exist, because the anchor IS the
// region. So the converse has no content to assert, and asserting it anyway
// is red on a correct tree: measured on this branch, TodayTab declares 3
// cascade steps and 4 anchors — the badge sits in `ScreenHeader`'s `right`
// slot with no cascade step of its own — and HoneycombTab declares 3
// anchors and no cascade at all. A bijection reds four times on the tree it
// lands on. A RULE MUST BE STATED IN THE DIRECTION THAT HAS CONTENT.
//
// WHY `StaggeredItem` AND NOT "every child of the content container": the
// general rule is false. HoneycombTab's scroll content has many direct
// children that are legitimately not anchors (the controls, the feed, the
// week list Lumen ratified as perch-only at the toggle), so a row demanding
// an anchor per child would be red on a screen that is correct. What
// `StaggeredItem` marks is narrower and is the right thing: a deliberate
// cascade step — a region the designer already declared arrives on its own
// and reads as a place. That is the same population the bee should be able
// to visit.
//
// NO EXEMPTION LIST, and that is a considered refusal rather than an
// omission. There are zero exemptions today, so a list would be AN EMPTY

    // arriving a third time inside the row I wrote BECAUSE of it: THE
    // INVARIANT IS ABOUT THE WORST RENDER STATE, NOT THE DECLARED SET. The
    // obvious way to anchor the hive shelf is to do it only when there is
    // something on it —
    //
    //     {hives.length > 0
    //        ? <PerchAnchor id="hive-shelf" …><View style={styles.hiveShelf}/></PerchAnchor>
    //        : <View style={styles.hiveShelf}/>}
    //
    // — and a presence walk finds the anchor and goes green. The state it is
    // wrong in is `hives.length === 0`: the first-run state, which is the
    // exact state the shelf ruling turned on. The row built to catch that
    // region would have passed the version of it that ships the defect.
    //
    // So `anchored` is not "an anchor exists below". It is: AN ANCHOR RENDERS
    // IN EVERY STATE THIS STEP RENDERS IN. Descending through a
    // `ConditionalExpression` therefore costs BOTH arms, and a
    // `LogicalExpression` is never certain, because its JSX operand is
    // precisely the one that may not render.
    //
    // THIS IS A DIFFERENT QUESTION FROM THE `conditional` FLAG BELOW, and the
    // footer proves they must stay two questions. `conditional` describes the
    // step's OWN ancestry — whether the `StaggeredItem` is itself inside a
    // branch. Index 2 is a conditional step holding an unconditional anchor,
    // which is CORRECT and must stay green. This asks about the path BETWEEN
    // the step and its anchor. Collapsing them would red the footer.
    //
    // WHAT IT CANNOT SEE: a branch that is not syntax. A component that
    // declines to render its children (`<Modal visible={x}>`) hides the same
    // hole behind a prop, and no AST walk reaches it. Neither host does that
    // today; if one ever does, this row will say yes and be wrong, and the
    // honest place to catch it is the call site.
    //
    // AN ANCHOR IN BOTH ARMS PASSES THIS ROW, AND YOU SHOULD STILL NOT WRITE
    // ONE. Both arms carrying an anchor does mean one renders in every state,
    // so a green here is correct — but the only spelling that gets there
    // gives ONE REGION TWO IDENTITIES, because written the natural way (one
    // region, one name) K2 reds on `duplicate ids: hive-shelf` (measured, not
    // reasoned: Sage's correction to a note of mine that stopped one step
    // short). And `PerchAnchor.js:117` says what two identities cost — the
    // anti-repeat memory is keyed on `id`, so two names for one place are two
    // places to `chooseAnchor`. Hoist the anchor ABOVE the ternary: one id,
    // unconditional, and the question does not arise.
    //
    // K3 DISAGREES WITH THIS ROW ON THAT SHAPE, AND THE DISAGREEMENT IS
    // FAIL-SAFE, WHICH IS WHY THERE IS NO ROW JOINING THEM. K3 measures each
    // anchor's own conditionality, so it cannot see that a pair is jointly
    // total and reads `2 unconditional of 6` where this row reads reachable.
    // That is an UNDERCOUNT against a `>= FLOOR` assertion, and an undercount
    // there can only ever produce a false RED — a conversation. This row's
    // old defect ran the other direction, which is what made it worth an
