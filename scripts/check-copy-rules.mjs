// Colin's copy rules, enforced against the words a user actually reads.
//
//   npm run check:copy-rules
//
// WHY THIS FILE EXISTS
//
// Two gates already carried the forbidden-word list and neither one checked a
// screen.
//
//   1. `check-demo-hive.mjs` runs the list over `demoHiveShares` — nineteen
//      fabricated demo records. Its comment says "everything that renders";
//      what it means is everything IN THAT FIXTURE that renders, and the two
//      are a launch apart. That gate is right about its own subject (the demo
//      set is authored copy too) and is left alone; it now imports the list
//      from here instead of keeping a second copy of it.
//
//   2. An untracked script in one agent's scratch directory ran the list over
//      `Onboarding.js` by regex, invisible to `npm test`. It had been red
//      since it was written — on an IMPORT STATEMENT, `import { LockScreen }
//      from './CoreRitual'`, which its line-based predicate could not tell
//      apart from a rendered word. A gate that always says "1 failed" with a
//      written explanation beside it trains everyone to read past its output,
//      and the next real red arrives in a slot people have learned to skip.
//      That script is retired by this file.
//
// So the coverage was upside down: eighteen tracked gates covered type floors,
// RLS, streak math and nav depth, and the thing Colin reviews more than all of
// them combined — the actual sentences — was enforced on fake data.
//
// TWO DESIGN DECISIONS, BOTH MEASURED RATHER THAN ASSUMED.
//
// (1) THE ENUMERATION IS A PROPERTY OF POSITION, NOT OF PATH.
//
// The obvious scope is "the screens with authored copy", written out as a
// list. Measured against `src/` at f0df9c2, a position-based collector finds
// copy in 26 files, and 7 of them are not screens: `AccountDoor.js`,
// `SealCrack.js`, `ThemeCardFlip.js`, `IdeasAccordion.js`, `HoneycombGrid.js`,
// `FeedCard.js`, `DevVersionTag.js`. A hand-written list of screens misses
// every one, and misses them silently — the gate stays green because it never
// looked. So this walks all of `src/` and filters by POSITION: a string is
// copy if it reaches a user's eyes or a screen reader, wherever it lives.
//
// The five positions, and what each one holds, are documented at the walker:
// scripts/lib/rendered-strings.mjs. This gate asks for ALL of them, because
// its question — does a user read a forbidden word — is indifferent to which
// slot the word sits in. The demo-content gate asks the same walker for two
// of them, because its question is not.
//
// `constant` is over-inclusive on purpose: it takes any prose-shaped string
// in `src/constants/`, which sweeps up a few things nobody reads. A false
// member of the copy set costs one re-read. A missing member costs the whole
// point of the gate. The over-inclusion is paid for in (2), not by narrowing
// the collector.
//
// (2) THE MATCHER IS PER-WORD, BECAUSE ONE RULE CANNOT FIT ALL TWELVE.
//
// Three matching rules, run over the real copy strings — 451 at f0df9c2 with
// this gate's own collector, 446 at b5e7754 once it moved to the shared
// walker (five strings, all of them a double count or a sentence collected
// in halves; the walker header has both effects measured, and no string was
// lost). All three arms return the same hits over either corpus:
//
//   raw substring          4 hits, all false — "single", "Using",
//                          "advertising", "consequential" all contain `sin`
//   \bword\b (boundary)    0 hits — but it cannot see "praying", "blessings",
//                          "faithful", "churches", which are the register the
//                          ban is actually about
//   \bword  (prefix)       1 hit, false — "single"
//
// `check-demo-hive` asserts the RAW SUBSTRING arm, and is correct to: over
// nineteen hand-written fixtures the false-positive rate is zero and the arm
// is free. It does not transfer. Ported unchanged to real copy it is red on
// four legal-page sentences on day one, which is how a gate acquires an
// allowlist that grows forever.
//
// So each word carries its own pattern. Eleven of them are prefix-at-word-
// boundary, which catches inflections and cannot fire mid-word. `sin` is the
// one word short enough to be the start of ordinary English, so it is spelled
// out with its inflections instead. The patterns are not trusted on their
// face: section B runs each one over words it MUST catch and words it must
// NOT, so recall and precision are asserted, not assumed.
//
// WHAT THIS GATE CANNOT DO. It reads literals in the source. Copy assembled
// at runtime from parts, or arriving from the network, is invisible to it —
// and a `CANNOT TELL` must not look like a clean pass, so section A asserts
// the collector's own universe is non-empty in every position before section
// C reports zero hits over it. A collector that silently stopped working
// would otherwise report a perfectly green rule over nothing at all.

// --- A. Collect the copy -----------------------------------------------

// THE COLLECTOR LIVES IN scripts/lib/rendered-strings.mjs, and its POSITION
// VOCABULARY is declared there once and used twice: the walker refuses to
// emit a position that is not in POSITIONS, and section A below derives one
// control per member of it. Neither half is decoration.
//
// The first draft named the controls in a hand-written list of four, and the
// collector emitted five. Sage measured the gap (2026-08-17): disabling
// `alert` collection dropped 34 strings — 7.5% of the corpus — and every
// assertion stayed green, over the one position that holds
// 'Demo: onboarding flow'. A gate arguing that a CANNOT TELL must not look
// like a clean pass had a clean pass sitting exactly there.
//
// Adding `'alert'` to that list would have fixed the count and kept the
// shape: the sixth position added in November lands in the same hole. So the
// two sets are tied together instead. A position cannot exist without a
// control, and a control cannot exist without a position — one goes red
// either way. This is section A's own argument applied to section A.
//
// This gate asks for ALL of POSITIONS rather than a written-out list of
// five, so a position added at the walker arrives here already covered: the
// question "does a user read a forbidden word" is indifferent to which slot
// the word sits in, and that indifference is the reason it may spread its
// scope automatically where the demo gate may not.
// App.js IS IN THE UNIVERSE, and it wasn't. This gate walked src/ only while
// check-demo-content-callsites walked `App.js + src/**` — two gates over the
// same tree disagreeing about what the tree IS, which is the divergence one
// shared walker was supposed to end. It holds exactly one prose string
// (`gratitudeText="I am grateful for this beautiful day."`, App.js:220, a
// hardcoded line handed to the Evening route) and that string was outside
// this gate for a reason TEXT_ATTRS could not fix: adding the attribute name
// recovers nothing in a file nobody reads. Two holes, one symptom.

//
// The other direction of the same tie: the walker throws rather than
// filtering when its classifier emits a position POSITIONS does not
// declare, because an undeclared position is in nobody's requested set and
// would otherwise leave silently. This row reports that throw under its own
// name — a file that will not parse and a walker whose two halves disagree

// THE MINUEND. The row above ties the classifier to the vocabulary; this
// one pins the vocabulary itself, and it is the only assertion in either
// gate that POSITIONS is not free to shrink. Everything else here is
// DERIVED from POSITIONS — the loop below, and the demo gate's
// `POSITIONS.filter(…)` — so deleting a member from both the list and the
// classifier is a coherent edit that leaves every derived control agreeing
// with itself over a smaller universe. Measured by Sage at 257aa2f:
// deleting `jsx-expr` takes 75 strings out of each gate, 33% of rule 1's,
// and both gates exit 0.
//
// It lives HERE rather than beside the demo gate's exclusion pin because
// only this gate's universe IS the whole vocabulary. That pin reads
// `RULE_1_OUT_OF_SCOPE`, which is a literal and does not move when
// POSITIONS does, so a pin on rule 1's own scope would cover the three
// positions it includes and be blind to the two it excludes — deleting
// `alert` would still cost this corpus 34 strings in silence.
//
// A tripwire, not a proof: no behavioural control can catch a scope that
// narrows itself, since narrowing removes the very rows that would object.
// Shrinking this list is legitimate — it just has to be typed here, next
// to what it costs.
//
// Sorted on both sides, because the property is MEMBERSHIP and POSITIONS'
// order carries no meaning: the walker's header lists the five in reading
// order, and a gate that reds when someone reorders a comment-matching
// list is red-on-correct-code with no defect behind it. `POSITIONS
// reordered` is a should-pass mutation on this branch and stays one.

// --- A2. TEXT_ATTRS is a partition, not a list -------------------------
//
// The `prop` position is decided by a NAMED LIST in the walker, and a named
// list has a list's hole: `title` was on it and `eyebrow` was not, so
// ScreenHeader.js rendered one collected string and one invisible one from
// the same call site through the same <Text>. Twenty-one strings were
// outside both gates that way, including LoadState's entire error-state
// surface on all three screens that carry it (Sage, thread 4510c5c8).
//
// Adding the names fixes today. This section is what stops it recurring:
// every attribute name in the tree that carries a string literal must be
// CLASSIFIED — copy (walker's TEXT_ATTRS) or not-copy (below) — and an
// unclassified name reds. A new copy-bearing prop can then ship only after
// somebody has written down which half it is in.
//
// TWO NETS, AND NEITHER IS THE OTHER'S FLOOR, because they fail in
// different directions:
//
//   NAME-level (row 1) catches a NEW attribute. It is the stronger net
//   because it does not read the string at all — which is what makes it
//   see `staleActionLabel="Refresh"`. A prose heuristic cannot: nothing
//   syntactic separates "Refresh" from "contain", "round" or "handled".
//   Sage's sweep, filtered on prose shape, reported 17 strings and named
//   six props; the same sweep run at NAME level reports 21 and seven, and
//   the missing name is exactly the one whose values are single words.
//   A HEURISTIC OVER VALUES CANNOT ENUMERATE A CLASS DEFINED BY ROLE.
//
//   VALUE-level (row 2) catches an OLD attribute that starts carrying copy
//   — `tone="danger"` today, `tone="Something went wrong"` in November.
//   Name-level is blind to that by construction, since the name is already
//   classified. This is the direction an exemption list usually leaks in.
//
// Read against TEXT_ATTRS itself rather than a second copy of the names:
// a gate matching a typed list proves a property of the list.
//
// THE RESIDUAL, AT ITS ACTUAL SIZE. A partition forces a decision, not a
// CORRECT one: faced with a red, someone can file a copy prop under
// NOT_COPY_ATTRS in a one-word edit. That hole is smaller than it sounds,
// and the precision matters — "misclassification is invisible" would be
// false and would invite machinery this does not need. Measured both ways
// at 25e1314 (Sage, thread 4510c5c8; reproduced here):
//
//   cta="Continue"                    filed NOT_COPY → exit 0   INVISIBLE
//   cta="Something went wrong here."  filed NOT_COPY → exit 1, row 2 reds
//
// So row 2 already covers the prose half of a misfile. The hole is exactly
// one shape: SINGLE-WORD COPY MISFILED AS NOT-COPY. What stands in front of
// it is that adding a name here is a reviewed source edit — a real defence,
// and a more honest thing to write down than a gate that has to be told to
// ignore its own only finding.
//
// TWO INSTRUMENTS WERE BUILT FOR THAT HOLE AND BOTH ARE REJECTED, recorded
// so nobody rebuilds one in November and stops at "one hit, must be a bug":
//
//   (a) identifiers rendered inside a <Text> must not appear in
//       NOT_COPY_ATTRS. 78 identifiers across 174 <Text> elements, 1 hit,
//       and it is FALSE: Avatar.js:69 renders initialsFor(name) — a
//       person's name, data rather than authored copy. (The way it could
//       have been live was the tab labels; refuted at MainTabs.js:101,
//       `tabBarShowLabel: false`, so route ids are never read by anyone.)
//   (b) a not-copy attribute may not carry a value beginning with a
//       capital. 16 hits, ALL of them `name=` route ids.
//
// Two independent probes, one day-one exemption, and it is the SAME name
// both times: `name` carries Ionicons icon ids AND navigator route ids, so
// every instrument aimed at this hole collides with it. That convergence is
// the evidence the residual is real and the instruments are not — an
// exemption is where the next affordance hides, which is the rule this
// whole section exists to keep.
// `id` and `on` are PerchAnchor's (§32) and nothing renders either: `id` keys
// `chooseAnchor`'s anti-repeat memory, `on` is the 'left' | 'right' side enum.
// Filed here rather than left unclassified because row 1 reds on an unknown
// name — and unlike `name`, neither has a second meaning to collide with:
// `check-bee-attitude` row K2 already asserts ids are unique and sides legal,
// so these two are constrained by a gate that knows what they are.

// A DIFFERENT SHAPE FROM SECTION C ON PURPOSE. `page` and `blank` are not
// banned — they are ordinary English, and stay ordinary English right up

// `fedeaff5`, 2026-08-19) ratified `NUDGE_ASK_LABEL` — "Let me know on days
// my page is still blank." — on the argument that it takes TodayTab's own
// blank-state vocabulary (`TodayTab.js:200`, "Today's page is blank.")
// rather than inventing a new noun. That argument holds only against the
// tree it was measured on: `line` was withdrawn the same way, after
// `fizz/private-hives-rails` spent it on a different object
// (`ComposeHiveEntry.js:56`, `CreateHive.js:180`) between one sweep and the
// next. "A sweep is evidence about today's trees, not tomorrow's" is Lumen's
// own stated reason for this section — the sweep found zero collisions
// across 48 trees, and this row is what makes a FUTURE collision fail loudly
// instead of shipping and being discovered by a human days later.
//
// EXACT STRINGS, NOT A REGEX CLASSIFIER, unlike section C's FORBIDDEN list.
// Section C asks "does this word appear at all" over an open-ended set of
// sentences nobody has written yet, which is why it needs recall/precision
// fixtures (section B). This asks "does this occurrence still name the ONE
// referent it is reserved to" — a closed, measured set, same convention as
// section D's FROZEN copy above. A hit whose exact text is not in the
// allowlist is a NEW spend of the word, and reds here rather than needing a
// second human sweep to notice.
//
