// Gate for the reveal sequencer's pacing (Sunbeam §31, `src/components/revealSequencer.js`).
//
//   npm run check:reveal-pacing
//
// WHY THIS EXISTS
//
// The acceptance bar for the reveal is a sentence, not a screenshot: *"if a
// tester screenshots it or cries, it passes; if they scroll it like a feed, it
// fails, whatever it looks like."* Every clause of that is about PACING, and
// pacing is the one property a design review cannot see — a still frame of a
// reveal that can be rapid-tapped in seven seconds is indistinguishable from a
// still frame of one that cannot. `PollinateWrapped.js` is the proof: it has
// looked correct in every screenshot anyone has taken of it while shipping a
// whole-screen `onPress` with no floor at all.
//
// So the floor gets a gate, and the gate SAMPLES THE FUNCTION rather than
// checking that a constant exists (R81). A sequencer is a generator of
// sessions; four sampled points cannot pin one, and the module is importable,
// so the rows below sweep its domain — every word count from 0 to 200, every
// tap offset around each floor boundary, and a full adversarial session
// against a sequence built out of the app's own corpus.
//
// R118 IS THE ROW THAT MATTERS MOST HERE, and it is a correction to my own
// earlier ruling. The engine used to derive its floor from the bloom duration
// alone ("the floor IS the arrival, and nothing longer"). Composed with the
// choreography spec's §2 — "the entry becomes readable AT THE END of the
// bloom" — that floor unlocked the tap at the instant the words first became
// legible and bought zero reading time. Section B row 4 is that defect written
// as an assertion: it goes red on the engine as it stood this morning, and it
// is the only row here that would have.
//
// WHAT THIS GATE CANNOT SEE, said plainly (§0: an absence claim inherits the
// scope of the probe that produced it). It cannot see the bloom, the rail's
// pixels, the haptic, or whether anybody cried. It asserts that the machine
// behind those refuses to be skimmed. The rail's COLOUR is checked in section
// D, but only as token arithmetic — no frame has been rendered.

//     frame: if `ink` or `background` is retuned, the rail ruling gets
//     re-derived instead of inherited.
//
//     THE ALPHA IS READ, NOT DECLARED. This row used to open `const TRACK_ALPHA
//     = 0.5` and check the arithmetic of that constant, which meant it verified
//     the RULED value and never the SHIPPED one — green by construction, unable
//     to fail on a screen shipping the wrong alpha. One was: PollinateWrapped's
//     ProgressSegment ran the unfilled track at 0.15 (1.3558:1, the very value
//     §23.11 ruled a defect) for as long as this row has been green. It now
//     reads `trackDim` off the token, so retuning the token re-derives the
//     ruling and mistyping it goes red.
