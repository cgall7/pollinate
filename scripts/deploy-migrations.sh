# project. This step did not exist anywhere in the repo before Project 1 —
# migrations landed on main and stopped there, so every feature that added
# a table (Notes, and Seeds right behind it) shipped in code while the prod
# database silently stayed on the previous schema.
#
#   npm run deploy:migrations
#
# Needs two things this script deliberately does not default or hardcode:
#   SUPABASE_PROJECT_REF   — the project ref from the dashboard URL
#   SUPABASE_ACCESS_TOKEN  — a personal access token (supabase.com/dashboard/account/tokens)
#
# `db push` only skips what's already applied if the remote's own history
# table (supabase_migrations.schema_migrations) says so. If earlier schema
# on this project was ever applied by hand through the dashboard SQL editor
# instead of this CLI, that table won't have those versions — push then
# starts from the oldest local migration, hits `42P07 relation already
# exists` on the first `create table`, and stops before touching the
# migrations you actually wanted applied. `migration list` below shows the
# local/remote diff *before* push runs, specifically so that failure mode is
# visible instead of looking like a broken script. See supabase/README.md
# for the repair command if local and remote disagree on the old versions.

# would do with that diff, and the gap between those two is where this goes
# wrong: `db push` without --include-all applies only migrations newer than
# the newest version in the remote history table, so a migration that landed
# on main *behind* an already-applied version is in the diff and is silently
# not in the push. That happens whenever branches merge out of timestamp
# order, which is normal, or whenever a deploy runs between two merges.
#
# --dry-run prints the exact list push would apply, against the real remote,
# without applying it. It turns "is anything going to be skipped?" from
# something you have to reason about into something you read. Same flags as
# the real push below, so what it prints is what the next command does.
#
# One caveat, checked rather than assumed: `db push` also syncs vault secrets
# from supabase/config.toml before migrations, and that part is not obviously
# covered by "don't actually apply them". There is no supabase/config.toml in
# this repo, so today there is nothing for it to write. If one is ever added
# WITH vault secrets, verify that before trusting this step to be read-only,
# or give this line --skip-vault (and accept that it then differs from the
# push it is previewing).
