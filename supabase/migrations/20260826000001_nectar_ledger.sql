-- Pollinate — nectar ledger core schema
--
-- STATUS: promoted to a real migration 2026-08-26 (Sage's ruling), SIMULATED
-- MODE ONLY. `ledger_settings.rails_mode` below defaults to 'simulated', and
-- the mode-guard trigger rejects any real (non-simulated) Strike observation
-- while that holds — so applying this migration operates no real money.
--
-- GATE ON FLIPPING rails_mode TO 'live': that flip is a separate, still-
-- embargoed decision. It requires answers to two questions this milestone
-- explicitly deferred — Strike agent-of-payee for third-party API customers
-- (../ledger/DESIGN.md §9) and the settlement currency of a paid USD-quoted
-- invoice (§13). Do not flip it, in any environment, until both are ruled on.
--
-- See ../ledger/DESIGN.md for the rationale behind every choice here; the
-- verify/ suite next to it executes this file against a real Postgres.
--
-- Model: strict double-entry. Postgres is the system of record for who owns what;
-- Strike is a payment rail we reconcile *against*, never a source of truth we
-- copy balances from.
--
-- Sign convention (the one thing to internalise before reading further):
--   amount_microusd > 0  ==  DEBIT
--   amount_microusd < 0  ==  CREDIT
--   Every transaction's postings sum to exactly 0.
--   Therefore the sum of ALL account balances is always exactly 0.
--   Assets (money we hold) carry positive balances.
--   Liabilities (money we owe users) carry negative balances.
-- A user's spendable balance is a liability, so it is stored negative. The
-- `user_nectar_balances` view at the bottom flips the sign for app consumption —
-- nothing outside this file should ever see the raw signed value.
--
-- Unit: integer micro-USD (1e-6 USD). $1.00 = 1000000. Never a float, never a
-- decimal type, never sats. Rationale in the design doc §2.

-- ============================================================================
-- Operating mode — the tripwire that keeps this schema off real money
--
-- Every observation of the outside world is tagged simulated/live, and a trigger
-- refuses any observation whose tag disagrees with the current mode. Until
-- someone deliberately flips this row to 'live', a real Strike poll is a
-- constraint violation, not a code review question.
