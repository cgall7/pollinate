// Demo-only hive members (Colin's ask, 2026-08-09): the honeycomb should
// always look lively for demos even with only 1-2 real connections. These are
// decorative — never written to Supabase, never counted in real
// connection/like/comment totals, and never interactive. The read-only
// register is `FeedCard`'s `isDemo` guard (§18.1.1), which is what keeps the
// like/comment affordances from rendering at all — the database rejecting a
// non-uuid `demo-N` id is a backstop that produces a dead control, not the
// guard itself.
//
// `HoneycombTab` merges them into the raw share list; the Today comb maps that
// list through `toGridMember`, the Last-7-Days view groups it by `entryDate`
// (§18.1.1). Pull this file and its call site whenever real usage makes it
// unnecessary.
//
// THE SET IS SIZED, NOT ARBITRARY — §18 partitions on date, which made these
// load-bearing. All three are asserted by `npm run check:demo-hive`, which
// runs this module for real and reads HIVE_SLOTS and the tint rotation out of
// the files that own them — so edit the list, run it, and believe the result
// rather than this paragraph:
//
//   * SEVEN members at daysAgo 0. `HIVE_SLOTS` is 7 (HoneycombGrid.js), and
//     the grid honestly leaves unfilled seats empty rather than padding them.
//     Fewer than seven and a demo user with no real connections sees a comb
//     that never closes — the one job this file exists to do.
//   * At least one member on EACH of daysAgo 1-6, so every day header in the
//     week view has something under it. Two each is what makes it read as a
//     populated week rather than a technically non-empty one.
//   * THE DAY-0 SEVEN MUST NOT GO MONOCHROME. `hexTintFor` (Avatar.js) is a
//     MOD-2 rotation over `hashName`, and those seven are the only cells a
//     fresh demo user ever sees. Nothing distributes them — a name list can
//     hash all one way by accident, and a 7/0 split is a one-color comb with
//     no error anywhere. Today it is 3 washYellow / 4 washSky at day 0 and
//     9 / 10 across all 19, which is luck, not design — changing one name is
//     enough to move it. The gate holds the minority tint at >= 2 of the
//     seven: a single odd cell in a ring reads as an accident, not a rotation.
//   * R-CL-3 (Lumen, 2026-09-04) RETIRES R59's authored state band. §21.9.1
//     used to author `blooming`/`seeded` here so a fresh tester would see
//     those states at all, and the gate held two rules over them (at most 3
//     of the day-0 seven blooming; at least one member carrying both). That
//     is struck: a SAMPLE'S JOB IS THE SHAPE OF A FULL COMB, NOT THE STATE
//     LEGEND. Colin opened the empty-state comb on a state zoo with no key —
//     three of seven wearing marks he had never earned and could not decode.
//     States now appear the first time a real person earns one. The mapper
//     below still emits both fields, always false: the row SHAPE is the
//     contract HoneycombTab merges real state into, and dropping the keys
//     would make `blooming` undefined rather than off.
//
// Day 0 first, then ascending — the pre-partition call site still takes the
// first `HIVE_SLOTS` of this list, so today's people have to come first.
