// Gratitude ideas — accordion categories (Sunbeam §6, frozen copy from
// GUIDES/GRATITUDE_IDEAS_ACCORDION_COPY.md).
//
// Five curated categories, each rendered as a card: `icon` in a washYellow
// circle, `title` in h3, `teaser` in bodySm. Expanding a card reveals its
// `sparks` — feed them straight into the existing <SparkChips> component.
// Only one category should be expanded at a time (R1 refinement, adopted
// into spec). Icon names are Ionicons, 22pt, matching the check-in-time card
// pattern.
