// Sunbeam §12.5 Motion QA Standard — single source of truth for every
// spring/timing curve in the app. Screens/components consume these
// constants instead of inlining friction/tension/duration literals, so
// "lots of motion" (§14.1 R9) reads as premium/cohesive rather than
// chaotic. Rule (Sage, §12.5 Section 1): "if a new animation can't be
// expressed via the shared module, that's a module problem, not a reason
// for a one-off." Extend here, not on the call site.
//
// Luxury pass (Lumen, 2026-08-20): this module's own docstring used to
// claim it had already collected BeeTransition, CelebrationRays,
// AnimatedStat, CelebrationBadge and PressableScale onto SPRINGS/DURATIONS
// — it hadn't; all five still ran inline literals byte-identical to the
// values declared here. That was a spec defect, not drift. Every call site
// named above (plus MainTabs' TabIcon landing spring and HoneycombGrid's
// reveal-card duration) now actually imports and uses these constants.
// Remaining per-screen literals (SparkChips, Onboarding, EveningMirror,
// CoreRitual breathing loops) are still follow-up work for the §14.1
// cohesion sweep, which by design (§12.5 build-order gate) runs against
// the *settled* tree rather than re-touching files mid-flight.
