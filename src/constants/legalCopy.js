// Privacy Policy + Terms of Service copy, drafted 2026-08-11 (Deezine).
//
// This replaces the `TODO — Deezine to draft` scaffold. It is plain-language
// copy written against what the app ACTUALLY does, verified in the schema and
// the client, not against the feature list we intended to build. Two things
// the scaffold's brief asked for are deliberately NOT in here because they do
// not happen:
//
//   * Phone numbers / contact discovery. `profiles.phone_hash` exists in
//     20260808000001 but has zero writers anywhere in src/ — real discovery is
//     an exact email match through `find_connectable_profile`. The app never
//     asks for contacts. Disclosing phone collection would be false.
//   * Avatar photo uploads. The `avatars` bucket exists (20260809000001) but
//     nothing in src/ uploads to it; Avatar.js only renders a URL if one is
//     present. No user can produce one today.
//
// Both are dead schema. If either is ever wired up, this file changes in the
// same commit — a privacy policy that lags the code is the failure mode here.
//
// TRIPWIRE — features on the roadmap that each falsify a specific sentence
// below. Landing any of these without editing this file ships a false statement
// in a legal document:
//
//   * An avatar image picker falsifies "never requests access to your ... camera
//     roll" in `What we collect`, and turns the dead `avatars` bucket real.
//   * Contact-based discovery falsifies "we do not ask for your phone number"
//     in the same paragraph, and turns `profiles.phone_hash` real.
//   * Flow C app-locking adds a data category this policy has no section for.
//     It needs new copy, NOT a pre-written sentence — see below.
//   * Daily-nudge open-rate or conversion metrics falsify two sentences here:
//     "nothing here reports what you do back to us or to anyone else" in
//     'The short version', and "We do not include analytics, attribution or
//     crash-reporting tools" in 'What we do not do'. Cited by heading and by
//     the sentence, not by line: a comment in this file moves the lines it
//     cites, which is how the first draft of this entry shipped both numbers
//     three short.
//
// On Flow C specifically, because the obvious reassuring line — "we can see
// that you locked apps, we cannot see which ones" — is not one sentence:
//
//   * iOS: true by construction once built, not a choice we make. Per Pixel's
//     R39, ManagedSettingsStore shields take `ApplicationToken`s that can only
//     come from the user's own FamilyActivityPicker selection, and cannot be
//     de-referenced to names by the app holding them. Note that
//     `services/NativeLockInterface.ts` contradicts itself on this without
//     needing any Apple documentation to see it: lines 7 and 33 cite
//     FamilyControls and ManagedSettingsStore, while lines 24 and 27 specify
//     `setBlockedApps(appIds: string[])` with plain bundle IDs. Those cannot
//     both be built. The framework half of that is Pixel's, from the docs, and
//     is not verifiable in this repo — the dev build settles it.
//   * Android: the genuinely open one. UsageStatsManager and
//     AccessibilityService both expose package names in the clear, and there
//     may be no opaque equivalent at any price.
//
// So the eventual copy may need a platform split, and whether Android's weaker
// truth caps what we promise everywhere is Colin's call, not this file's.
//
// None of it gets written yet. The module is an unimplemented stub with zero
// callers, so the app collects nothing here today and silence is correct —
// write the copy when it has a caller, from the code, the same way the rest of
// this file was written.
//
// NOT LEGAL ADVICE and not lawyer-reviewed. This is honest, specific,
// user-readable copy that describes real behaviour; it still wants a lawyer's
// pass before launch, particularly the liability and governing-law terms.
//
// Fill the four constants below to publish. `LEGAL_COPY_READY` is derived from
// them rather than hand-maintained, so the signup consent gate can key off
// something that cannot drift out of sync with the copy — see Onboarding's
// `agreedToTerms`, which must not require agreement to an unpublished document.

// --- The four things that must be filled before publishing ------------------
// One entry per value: what to set, and what a reader sees until it is set.
// The Legal screen is allowed to ship before this copy is final, so an unfilled
// value has to read as a sentence rather than as developer debris — someone who
// opens the page early should see an honest gap, not the word TODO.
//
// Value and placeholder live in the SAME entry, and the copy and the publish
// gate below read them through the SAME predicate, on purpose. The first cut of
// this file kept two objects and two tests — `??` (null or undefined) for the
// copy, `!== null` for the gate — and they disagreed. `undefined`, `''` and
// '   ' all rendered as an unfilled placeholder while flipping the gate to
// ready, which is the one outcome this whole mechanism exists to prevent:
// forcing someone to tick "I agree" against a document that still says
// "[the publisher of this app]". A derived flag is only as good as the
// predicate it derives through. (Caught by Sage.)
const FILL = {
  LEGAL_ENTITY: {
    // Still null on purpose after the Pollinate rebrand (§19.4): "Pollinate"
    // is a product name, not a registered entity, and filling this with the
    // app's name is exactly the false-fill the publish gate below exists to
    // prevent. Wants the registered company name.
    value: null,
    // Has to read as a noun phrase in two different sentences: "published by X"
    // in the policy and "an agreement between you and X" in the terms.
    placeholder: '[our legal name — to be named before launch]',
  },
  CONTACT_EMAIL: {
    value: null, // privacy requests + deletion + content removal
    placeholder: '[our contact address — to be published before launch]',
  },
  HOSTING_REGION: {
    value: null, // Supabase region for project vrpwodqtksjvirdvrqkv
    placeholder: '[a region we will name here before launch]',
  },
  EFFECTIVE_DATE: {
    value: null, // e.g. '11 August 2026'
    placeholder: 'Draft — not yet published',
  },
};

// The only definition of "published" in this file. Anything that is not a
// non-empty string is unpublished: null, undefined, '', '   '.
const isPublished = (value) => typeof value === 'string' && value.trim() !== '';

const filled = (key) => {
  const entry = FILL[key];
  // A key with no FILL entry would otherwise interpolate `undefined` into a
  // legal document, or — worse — leave the copy reading as a placeholder while
  // LEGAL_COPY_READY below still counted four published values and went true.
  //
  // KNOW THE BLAST RADIUS before you change this to something softer: App.js
  // imports Legal.js which imports this file, all statically, and these calls
  // run at module scope. A throw here white-screens the app at launch, not just
  // the Legal modal. That is the intended trade — a rename is a deliberate edit
  // to a four-key object ten lines above, there is no test suite to catch it,
  // and failing on every launch beats shipping a legal document that silently
  // reads as a draft behind a required "I agree". (Blast radius identified by
  // Sage; keeping the throw is a considered choice, not an oversight.)
