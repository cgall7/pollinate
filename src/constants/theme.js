  // Golden Honey — the adaptive icon's locked gold (§13.1), and the KEEPSAKE
  // REGISTER: the field a finished, kept thing stands on. Today that is the
  // Seal that opens Wrapped, the Year Card that closes it, and the month-theme
  // flip. Deliberately NOT `accent`: the two are only 1.179:1 apart, close
  // enough that a keepsake next to an accent fill reads as a printing error
  // rather than a second colour. Promoted to a token in §17.5 after living as
  // a hand-copied literal in three files.
  //
  // §29.1 — ADMISSION. Gold is a MATERIAL, not an emphasis. A surface may wear
  // it only if all three hold:
  //   1. FINISHED  — no further authoring by the user is expected of it.
  //   2. KEPT      — it persists as an artifact, not as a view of live data.
  //   3. SINGULAR  — a specific thing with an identity, not a summary of things.
  // A streak count fails (2). A balance fails (2) and (3). An in-progress
  // private hive fails (1); a sealed one passes all three.
  //
  // Material is a property of the object, so it does NOT change when a second
  // object of the same kind arrives — WP-2's "at most one gold surface per
  // screen" is WITHDRAWN (§29.1). A count rule makes the register a function of
  // position in a list, and then gold means "the first one", which is a rank.
  // Three sealed hives are three gold cards. What survives the withdrawal: gold
  // may never carry EMPHASIS (emphasis is relative, material is not), and GOLD
  // MAY NOT BE THE GROUND — it sits on a non-gold page and the cream must still
  // read as the page.
  //
  // TEXT ON THIS FIELD IS SINGLE-TIER. `ink` is 10.01:1 and is the only legal

  // 1.53:1; white is 1.71:1 (R15, remeasured §29.2). So hierarchy on a gold
  // surface comes from size, weight and position — never from colour (§23.9.2b).

  // colour of something WRITTEN (text, a fill, a progress rail's fill and its
  // track — §23.11 names `ink` for that pair explicitly); `inkVeil` is the colour

  // cover nobody has invented yet, which is the property worth having: nothing
  // here is tuned per-cover, so a fifth cover cannot arrive mis-lit.
  //
  // ZERO NEW HEX — two alphas of pigments already in the palette, which keeps
  // §1's "no new hex values introduced" intact for the covers.
  //
  // FOUR STOPS, not three, and the two middle ones are deliberately both fully
  // transparent: a single transparent midpoint would force the renderer to

  // is the worst case for the cover-legibility floor. Measured against
  // `surface`: at 0.20 the four covers sit at 12.91 / 8.78 / 5.76 / 5.87 ΔE00,
  // clearing a floor of 5 with the thinnest margin on `starlight`. At 0.35 the
  // minimum falls to 4.77 and two covers breach it. Anything raising this alpha
