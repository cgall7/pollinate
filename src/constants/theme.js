  // §29.1 — ADMISSION. Gold is a MATERIAL, not an emphasis. A surface may wear
  // it only if all three hold:
  //   1. FINISHED  — no further authoring by the user is expected of it.
  //   2. KEPT      — it persists as an artifact, not as a view of live data.
  //   3. SINGULAR  — a specific thing with an identity, not a summary of things.
  // A streak count fails (2). A balance fails (2) and (3). An in-progress
  // private hive fails (1); a sealed one passes all three.
  //
  // Material is a property of the object, so it does NOT change when a second
  // object of the same kind arrives — WP-2's "at most one gold surface per
  // screen" is WITHDRAWN (§29.1). A count rule makes the register a function of
  // position in a list, and then gold means "the first one", which is a rank.
  // Three sealed hives are three gold cards. What survives the withdrawal: gold
  // may never carry EMPHASIS (emphasis is relative, material is not), and GOLD
  // MAY NOT BE THE GROUND — it sits on a non-gold page and the cream must still
  // read as the page.

    //   2. ONCE THE SURROUND IS DIMMED, THE HOTTEST STOP WINS. The spotlight
    //      test — lit cell L* minus room L*, `bloom`, room dimmed by
    //      `inkVeil`, on the PAGE. This table settled DIRECTION (which pigment
    //      glows), and that ruling stands. It is NOT the current dim: R6 moved
    //      `colors.spotlightDim` off `inkVeil` and onto a derived pigment,
    //      because this table's ground is the page and the dim is painted on
