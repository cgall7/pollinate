// 8.4 — the surface that makes a planted seed exist.
//
// Until this screen, `plantSeed` succeeded and the modal closed over nothing:
// there was no view anywhere in the app that showed a seed back. Chrome is
// NotesInbox's, deliberately — two lists, one toggle, detail folded in rather
// than a second route — because a seed is a note that arrives late, and two
// inboxes that behave differently would be two things to learn.
//
// WHAT THIS SCREEN IS CAREFUL ABOUT, AND WHY IT IS THE WHOLE JOB
//
// §22.1: the seal renders off `bloom_at`, never off `content == null`. Both
// facts arrive on every row, and they are independent — a seed you SENT hands
// back its text while still sealed, because the select policy names
// `sender_id` with no bloom condition. So `resolveSeedView` decides whether
// the seal has opened and `direction` decides whether there is text you are
// entitled to read. Collapsing those two is the error I published and
// retracted this morning.
//
// §22.2: the reveal is a refetch, not a timer. `listReceived()` at time T
// returns `content: null` for everything with `bloom_at > T`, because the
// policy is evaluated at query time. A countdown reaching zero on a cached row
// produces no text — we never had the text. So the wake does not open a seal;
// it asks again, and the seal opens on what comes back. If the server still
// seals it, the device clock was fast: stay sealed, retry.
//
// NOT BUILT HERE, ON PURPOSE: 8.8's reveal choreography. The transition
// sealed -> bloomed is live and observable on this screen — that is the
// mechanism §22.2 requires and it is the part that had to be right. The beat
// itself is @Pixel's, and inventing durations for it here is exactly the R61
// failure mode. The seam is `SeedRow`, which re-renders with a new `view` the
// moment the refetch lands.
