//   - the belief screens B1–B3 -> src/constants/prompts.js, as the first
//     three days' prompts (FIRST_DAYS_PROMPTS). The argument arrives one
//     line a day, which is the product's own thesis applied to its pitch.
//   - the Moment step -> waits for notifications to exist, then returns at
//     the Celebration beat as a real permission ask (§27.2: never describe
//     a capability that doesn't exist).
//   - the Lock demo -> promoted. The Landing IS the gate now, so the
//     preview became the thing it was previewing.

    //      an asymmetry that sat unnamed in the module until Sage measured
    //      it). App.js's foreground reconcile already ran at launch, BEFORE
    //      that flag existed, and the next background->active transition may
    //      not arrive before tomorrow 20:00. A user who taps yes, finishes
    //      onboarding and pockets the phone would get no nudge on night one
    //      — exactly the cohort the feature exists for.
    //   2. `rearmDailyNudge` sources its written days from `EntryStore`,
    //      whose `requireUserId` throws "Not signed in", and there IS no
    //      session at this beat — STEP_ACCOUNT is two beats away, which is

// classifier: asking wrongly costs one tap on a decline link, not asking
// costs the activation event invisibly, and the classifier that exists
// (themeTagger) fires on the WORD for a relationship, not the presence of a
// person — 53.8% recall over the app's own 81 suggested first lines, and

// is the one a later pass reverts by accident:
//
//   placeholder  "A name" — the design said "A name, a thought, or leave it
//     blank". `subject_name` is a label for a person; a hive named after a
//     thought renders as one everywhere it is ever shown, and "leave it
//     blank" invites an empty write on a `not null` column when the decline
//     link already covers exactly that.
//
//   CTA  "That's who" — the design said "Keep it", which is the Celebration
//     CTA one screen back AND the account h1 one screen forward, both frozen
//     R15 copy. Three "keep it"s in a row makes the middle one look like the
//     same act repeated; the account IS the act of keeping, and this beat is
//     inside it, not another copy of it.
//
//   helper line  CUT — it read "Optional — write for someone, or keep it for
//     yourself", which both spends "keep it" a fourth time and describes
//     keeping-for-yourself as a mode the app does not have. The decline link
//     is the optionality signal; a sentence explaining that a visible skip
//     link is a skip link is explanation, and §30.5 says onboarding's job is
//     activation.
//
// The beat does NOT say or imply the entry goes into the hive, because it
// does not (R102, §30.7): the entry stays in the personal journal, the hive
// is created empty, and filing entries into it is C7.

  // washYellow (#FFF3C4) accentDeep #FF7A00 is 2.35:1, which fails 4.5:1
  // and fails the 3:1 large-text path too; these are bodySm 14px = 10.5pt,
  // so that path was never available. inkSoft #6B5F3D is 5.67:1 on the same
  // ground. A link colour is not a licence: the pair decides, never the

  // looked like `declineLinkText` would read as the opposite of what it
  // does. The chip geometry is `SparkChips`' existing quiet-affirmative
  // control, not a new shape. Colour is forced: this beat's wash is
  // `washYellow`, where `accentDeep` measures 2.35:1 and fails 4.5:1 at
  // every size this text can be — `ink` (15.39:1) and `inkSoft` (5.67:1)
