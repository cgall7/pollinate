// and three paths on this file disprove it: a seed you SENT returns its text
// while still sealed (the select policy names `sender_id` with no bloom
// condition), `plantSeed` used to return null for a seed the caller had just
// typed, and a broken or renamed embed also lands on null. An absence carries
// the union of every reason it could be absent, so it cannot identify one of
// them. `bloom_at` is a positive fact, present on every row either list
// returns, and it is the thing to branch on.
//
// Corollary worth knowing before you write a view: `hasBloomed(seed) &&
// content == null` has no legitimate meaning. It is a clock disagreement or a
// broken embed — render sealed and refetch, never an error, never an opened
// seal over nothing.
