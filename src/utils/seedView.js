// reading it. `hasBloomed` used to live in `SeedsStore.js`, which imports
// `./supabase` and therefore React Native — so the one rule that decides
// whether a seal opens could only be checked through a resolve-time stub. It
// is pure derivation and it belongs where it can be run. `SeedsStore` still
// exports it, so no caller changed.

/** True once a seed's bloom date has passed. Derived, never stored — see the

/** How a single seed should RENDER, plus whether the screen owes it a refetch.
 *
 *  Three inputs collapse to two views, and the third row is the whole point:
 *
 *  | bloom_at | content | view      | refetch |
 *  |----------|---------|-----------|---------|
 *  | future   | any     | `sealed`  | no      |
 *  | past     | present | `bloomed` | no      |
 *  | past     | null    | `sealed`  | **yes** |
 *
 *  Row 3 is §22.1's tripwire. `hasBloomed && content == null` has no
 *  legitimate meaning: it is a clock disagreement or a broken embed, and
 *  BOTH are answered by rendering sealed and asking again. Never an error
 *  — the user did nothing — and never an opened seal over nothing, which is
 *  the one outcome that would make the product lie about the thing it exists
 *  to do.
 *
 *  Note what is NOT here: `direction`. A seed you sent returns its text while
 *  still sealed (`seed_contents_select_after_bloom` names `sender_id` with no
 *  bloom condition), so a sent seed is routinely `sealed` WITH content in
 *  hand. The view and the availability of text are independent — that is
 *  §22.1's ruling in its most literal form — so the row decides what to show
 *  from `direction`, and the seal decides only whether it has opened. */

// Checked, and it does NOT apply here — recorded so nobody "fixes" it later:
// in Node, `setTimeout(fn, 2**31)` fires after 1ms (TimeoutOverflowWarning,
// reproduced). React Native does not share that clamp; the duration stays a
// double the whole way down. RN 0.86.2 as installed, four hops:
//
//   JSTimers.js:220          `createTimer(id, duration || 0, …)` — no clamp
//   RCTTiming.mm:357         bridge arg typed `(NSTimeInterval)jsDuration`
//   RCTTiming.mm:386,391     `targetTime` computed, passed to `_RCTTimer`
//   RCTTiming.mm:49          `[NSDate dateWithTimeIntervalSinceNow:targetTime]`
//
// `NSTimeInterval` is a `double` at every hop, so there is no 32-bit truncation
// anywhere on the path. The 24.8-day overflow is a Node fact, not an app fact.
// The horizon above exists for the unmount and background reasons, which are
// real on device — not for an overflow that isn't.
//
// The first version of this comment cited `RCTTiming.mm:386-393` for
// `dateWithTimeIntervalSinceNow`. That range is where `targetTime` is computed
// and handed to the timer; the `NSDate` call is 340 lines earlier, in
// `_RCTTimer`'s initialiser. Conclusion unchanged, citation was pointing at the
// middle of the chain instead of its end.

/** When the screen should next re-read, as a DELAY in ms, or null for "don't
 *  hold a timer."
 *
 *  Two things can want a wake, and the sooner one wins:
 *    - a seed whose `bloom_at` is still ahead of us — wake exactly then
 *    - a seed in the tripwire — wake in `SEAL_RETRY_MS`
 *
 *  Deliberately no skew margin on the bloom wake. A device running fast wakes
 *  early, the refetch returns a seed the server still seals, and that lands on
 *  the tripwire — which retries. The early wake is self-correcting, so paying
 *  for it with a fixed margin would only make every honest device late. */

  // once and never re-read. So `delay` is always positive and the clamp was
