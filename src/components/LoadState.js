// §23 — the state the app cannot express.
//
// Sage found that `finally { setLoading(false) }` renders every screen at its
// initial state, and Pixel measured what that means: for a user with no
// connections, a FAILED load and a SUCCESSFUL one render identically. Not
// similar — identical. The app owns `empty` and `loading` and has been using
// `empty` to mean `failed`.
//
// This is §23.8's one component. Four consumers: HoneycombTab, NotesInbox,
// ComposeNote, and PlantSeed (8.2, the first one built against it). The
// screens keep the §23.2 tier judgement — whether a given call's absence
// changes what the screen asserts about the user is a per-call decision and
// cannot live in here.
//
// WHAT THIS DELIBERATELY DOES NOT RENDER: `loading`, `ready` and `empty`.
// §23.4 says retry transitions to `loading` and reuses the screen's existing
// ActivityIndicator — "do not invent a third indicator" — and `empty`'s copy
// is per-screen content, not a shared slot. So those three return null and the
// screen renders its own. This component's whole subject is the two states
// that did not exist before it.
//
// COPY IS DEEZINE'S AND THERE ARE NO DEFAULTS IN HERE, on purpose. §23.3's
// draft wording is marked "to be replaced, not shipped"; a default is how a
// placeholder ships. Callers pass the slots, `check-load-state.mjs` asserts
// they did, and replacing the wording is a prop change on four call sites
// rather than an edit to this file.

// The §23.1 decision itself lives in `utils/loadState.js` — plain JS, no JSX,
// so `check-load-state.mjs` can execute it instead of reading it. Re-exported
// here so a consumer still has one import for the rule and the pixels.
//
// Imported (not just re-exported) because this file uses LOAD_STATES itself
// below — `export { X } from 'y'` forwards X to importers but creates no
// local binding, so every reference to LOAD_STATES in this module threw
// `ReferenceError` at render time until this import existed.
