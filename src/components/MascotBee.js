// §19.5 / R79 — **the mascot itself, flying.** Colin: "never have any other
// bee than our mascot." A redraw cannot satisfy that by construction — the
// best flat cousin is still a likeness — so the character in flight is the
// ratified 3D render, split into two layers so it can still beat its wings.
//
// **Why a split raster has parts.** R70 concluded it doesn't, off the render's
// alpha: 89% fully opaque, no second population. That measured a *material*
// property when separability is a *geometric* one — the only thing you cannot
// recover is what something else is painted over. The wings sit entirely
// behind and to the left of the body; body pixels straddle the wing span in 22
// of 1254 rows, and those rows are legs, which belong to the body layer
// anyway. So a mask splits it and nothing has to be painted back in.
//
// **The cutout does not use R70's luma key.** That recipe took alpha from
// luminance against the black plate, which is right for the wings — genuinely
// translucent, and bright enough that luma tracks their opacity — and wrong by
// construction wherever the subject is dark. The mascot's dark pixels are its
// bands, eyes, brows and antennae: every feature that carries the character.
// Measured on the first split, the bands recomposited at median max-channel
// 117 against the source's 42, because their alpha averaged 0.752 and the
// cream ground came through. The yellow body reproduced exactly, which is why
// the recipe looked solved — it had been validated on the pixels that could
// not fail it. Alpha now comes from a filled subject mask (a dark band is
// interior, whatever its luma) and the luma ramp survives only inside the wing
// region. Bands rebuild at 17.0 against the source's 17.0.
// Pipeline: `.scratch/r82-mascot-flight/build_layers.py`.
//
// **The character is not levelled.** Its body axis is drawn climbing (−45.6°
// abdomen-to-head, −55.3° by thickness-weighted PCA — two measurements that
// agree on a quantity which turns out not to decide anything). Rotating the
// body level tips the *head*, because the head is already drawn upright: what
// a viewer reads as the character's attitude is set by the face, not the body
// axis. Rendered side by side at the four real cruise attitudes, the drawn
// pose reads upright and airborne at every one and the levelled pose reads as
// a face-plant. So the drawn pose IS the flight pose, and `bank` tips it from
// there. Sheet: `.scratch/r82-mascot-flight/flight_attitudes.png`.
//
// Sizing is a drop-in for `StripedBee`: `size` is the box side, and the
// character is drawn at `MASCOT_WIDTH_FRACTION` of it — the same fraction of
// its box that StripedBee's drawing occupies (0.683), so every anchored call
// site keeps its footprint. It comes out taller (0.708 vs 0.47 of the box),
// which is the head and the trailing abdomen that StripedBee doesn't have.

// Hero LOD, `design/pipeline/`-cut and landing with its first real mount
// above `MASCOT_BASE_PX` (Lumen's ruling, thread 01325980, requirement 3) —
// one writer for the character's pixels, so the bundle carries no megabytes
// nothing draws until a caller actually needs them. Metro's dependency
// collector treats a `require` wrapped in try/catch as an OPTIONAL
// dependency: verified empirically (`expo export`, clean bundle, zero
// warnings) that it does not fail resolution when the file is absent, unlike
// a bare top-level `require` of a missing asset, which throws unconditionally
// at bundle time regardless of whether the branch is ever reached. That is
// what makes "switch first, asset later" buildable rather than just ordered.
//
// The pair is assigned atomically: both requires resolve into locals first,
// and HERO_WING/HERO_BODY only commit together at the end of the try block.
// If they were assigned directly and the pair ever half-landed (one file
// present, one missing), the second require's throw would leave the first
// one committed — hero wing over base body, a mixed-LOD state requirement 3
// assumes can't happen because the pipeline always cuts both at once.

// §12.5.1b makes for springs: a named curve fixes shape, not duration. The
// hero pose needs it: a held bee flicks twice and rests, and a bee that
// buzzes continuously at 148pt reads like a loading spinner rather than a
// character. `flutter` is the built-in loop for everything that is in transit.
