// The hive's hexagon MATH, split out from `HexShape.js` (2026-08-25,
// declared-ambient registry ruling, thread 8d2c9a5d msg 2c01adf3): a script
// deriving the BloomRing tripwire region needs to call `hexEdgeMarks` with a
// bare `node` import, and `HexShape.js` also exports a JSX component
// (`<Svg>`/`<Polygon>`) that only Metro/Babel can parse — importing the file
// for its math pulled in syntax `node` can't compile. Same split
// `combLattice.js` already is to `HoneycombGrid.js`: pure geometry lives
// where anything, script or component, can import it; the component that
// draws it lives next door and imports it too, so there is still exactly
// one copy of each formula.
//
// Flat-top, vertex-on-the-right — the same orientation HoneycombGrid's
// lattice is built from, so anything drawn with this reads as a piece of
// the same comb. `size` is the circumradius, so a cell is `size * 2` wide
// and `size * √3` tall.
//
// Written out as vertices rather than derived from a bounding box because
// the lattice maths (axialToPixel) and the polygon have to agree on what
// `size` means; deriving one from a box is how the Recap comb ended up
// with cells that never touched.

// The "seeded" badge: a small hexagon seal on the cell's lower-right VERTEX
// ray (60° from centre), figure knocked out to whatever painted beneath it
// rather than painted in a second colour — R51's register rule, "it never
// flew," applied to a mark instead of a stripe. Two nested hexagons at one
// center, `evenodd`, punch the hole; draw the returned path in the SAME
// `Svg` as the cell's own fill so the hole reveals that fill, not a bare
// transparent gap.
//
// §21.10 (R59): this used to sit on the lower-right EDGE ray (30°, the
// midpoint of vertices 0 and 1) — the same ray `hexEdgeMarks` centres a
// blooming mark on, so the two collided 77% of the mark's width whenever a
// member was both blooming and seeded, and the ring silently read as five
// marks instead of six. `hexEdgeMarks` occupies the six EDGE directions, so
// the six VERTEX directions are free by construction. Moved to the 60°
// vertex ray at 0.682 × the circumradius. Seal radius unchanged.
//
// R61 correction (Pixel): angular clearance is the wrong instrument here —
// it's a 1D projection only valid when both marks sit at the same radius,
// and they don't (seal centre 30.01, mark centre 33.61). The real,
// 2D-measured clearance from the seal's boundary to the mark's ink is
// 2.216pt (6.65px @3x) — and that figure is CONSTANT for any seal distance
// ≥ 0.64 × circumradius, because the seal's flat face runs parallel to the
// mark, so sliding along the vertex ray doesn't change the gap. What binds
// at 0.682 is the cell edge, at 4.50pt clearance — so 0.682 sits mid-
// interval, not on a knife-edge.
