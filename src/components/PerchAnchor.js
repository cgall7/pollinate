// Sunbeam §32.2 — where the bee is allowed to land, declared by the screen.
//
// §32's whole argument is that a flight needs DESTINATIONS rather than
// waypoints, and a destination the bee invents is a waypoint wearing a better
// name. So the screen names them, and it names them by wrapping the thing
// itself: `<PerchAnchor>` around the streak card says "the streak card is
// somewhere worth landing on", and the coordinates are whatever that card
// turns out to occupy tonight.
//
// **THE ANCHOR SET IS NOT A TABLE, IT IS THE RENDER TREE.** This is the one
// design decision in this file and everything else follows from it.
//
// Deezine's choreography guide states the anchor count per RENDER STATE —
// TodayTab blank is 3, written is 4, HoneycombTab's week view is 1 and
// therefore gets no bee. A literal table of that shape is a second copy of the
// screen's own conditionals, kept in sync by whoever remembers it exists, and
// Sage found the first drift in it before a line of this was written (the
// write-CTA anchor lives inside the empty-state arm, so it vanishes the moment
// the user writes). A `<PerchAnchor>` inside that arm cannot drift: it
// registers when the arm renders and unregisters when it stops. The count per
// state is then a CONSEQUENCE of the JSX rather than an assertion about it,
// and `check-bee-attitude` section K reads the same JSX to enumerate states.
//
// **Measure-on-use, not cache-on-layout — and here it dissolves a defect
// rather than merely avoiding one.** The guide flags TodayTab's scrolling
// content as a latent constraint: static anchor coordinates go stale when the
// user scrolls and the bee flies to where a card used to be. `read()` calls
// `measureInWindow` at the moment the sequencer chooses, so there is no
// coordinate to go stale — no scroll handler, no throttle, no re-render per
// frame, and no state to keep. `FlyingBee.readOrigin` already established both
// the technique and its failure mode (synchronous on this stack; if it ever
// stops being, the write lands late and the previous value is returned, which
// is exactly cache-on-layout — never worse).
//
// What it does NOT survive is the one thing nothing here survives: a
// natively-driven ancestor transform is invisible to `measureInWindow`
// (§28.13). That is the same structural guarantee the pollinate mount already
// depends on, stated once in `FlyingBee`.
//
// AND THIS SCREEN HAS A LIVE INSTANCE OF IT, so it is named here rather than
// rediscovered as a bug (Sage, 2026-08-17). Every TodayTab anchor sits inside
// a `StaggeredItem`, whose `Animated.View` drives `translateY` with
// `useNativeDriver: true` — exactly the case above. It is BOUNDED BY
// CONSTRUCTION rather than by luck: the entrance runs `Animated.timing` to a
// terminal of `translateY: 0` (`StaggeredItem.js:115-118`, outputRange
// `[14, 0]`), so the discrepancy is at most 14pt, only downward, and only
// while the cascade is in flight — 380ms per item, and with `count`
// defaulting to 1 the delays are `index * 50`, so the last of four items has
// settled by 530ms from mount. Any sortie chosen after that aims at the
// settled frame, and one chosen during it aims at most 14pt off a card that
// is still visibly arriving. `pop` would swap `translateY` for `scale` and
// change that bound; neither perch host passes it.
//
// Window coordinates cross the boundary, §28.2 unchanged — the same currency
// `pollinate` already uses, converted once inside the flight's own box.
