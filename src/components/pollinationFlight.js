// Sunbeam §28 — the pollination tap, as arithmetic.
//
// You tap a face in your hive and the bee comes over and agrees with you.
// He breaks from the cruise loop wherever he happens to be, climbs to a
// staging point one lattice step above the cell, drops onto it, puffs
// pollen, and ambles back to the loop.
//
// What he does *not* do is fetch your card. §28.1, ratified: **the bee is
// never the acknowledgement, and never on the critical path of something the
// user asked for.** He decorates the SOURCE you tapped, never the PAYLOAD you
// wanted. The cell answers at t=0 (stroke + haptic) and the reveal card runs
// its existing 260ms unchanged — so time-to-content is identical to the build
// without him, which is the only reason a p95 of ~1.1s is affordable at all.
//
// This module is deliberately dependency-free — no React, no react-native, no
// theme, no `motion` — for the same reason `beeAttitude.js` is: it lets
// `scripts/check-bee-attitude.mjs` **import and sample these functions**
// rather than pattern-match the source of a file it cannot load. R81: sample
// the function, not the flight. Four live waypoints cannot pin a rule; a
// domain sweep can. The moment this file grows an import, the gate degrades
// to string-matching and rows 5 and 6 stop meaning anything.
//
// Easing functions arrive as arguments for the same reason. They are plain
// `(w) => number` in React Native, so nothing is lost by not importing them.

// §28.5 — the approach is specified as a RATIO to the cruise, not as a
// pixels-per-second constant. What reads as "he broke off to come here" is
// that he is moving faster than he was a moment ago; the absolute figure
// (375 px/s at 393x852) is a consequence of the container, not a design
// decision, and would be wrong on the next screen size.
export const APPROACH_SPEED_RATIO = 2;

// §28.5 — the descent is a GESTURE, not a traverse, so it is specified as a
// duration. Its distance is the staging offset by construction (see
// `buildPollinationPlan`), so fixing the duration fixes the speed: 30.07pt in
// 160ms = 187.9 px/s at beeSize 44, which is cruise speed (187.59) — he
// settles onto the face at the pace he was already flying, rather than
// dropping onto it. Flown on `Easing.out(cubic)` so he lands rather than
// arrives.
//
// §28.11 / C′ — this was 240ms when the drop was a full ring step (76.21pt).
// Shortening the drop without shortening the duration would have made the
// settle a crawl at 125 px/s, two thirds of cruise; the dial moved with the
// distance it is the duration of.
export const DESCENT_MS = 160;

// §28.4 / C′ — how far above the face he hangs before he settles onto it.
//
// R87 measured the defect this replaces. The staging point used to be ONE
// RING STEP above the cell, and a ring step is the lattice's own pitch, so
// "one step above the cell" IS "the seat above it" wherever one exists: four
// of seven seats staged on another member's face, and the approach eases out
// into the phase split, so the slowest moment of the whole beat — a full
// stop — happened over the wrong person. R88: **a quantity borrowed from a
// lattice inherits the lattice's occupancy.** "Not a new number" justifies a
// SCALE; it never justifies a POSITION.
//
// So the offset is the BEE's dimension, not the comb's: he hangs his own
// length above the face he came to. §28.3's noun rule, again — the number is
// a length either way, and which noun it is a length OF decides where he
// stops. It moves with the character now, not with the lattice.
//
// The bound is the target cell's apothem, `ringStep / 2` (38.105pt at
// cellSize 44). Past it the staging point crosses the Voronoi boundary into
// the seat above and the defect is back. `STAGING_SAFETY` keeps it off the
// boundary itself, because at exactly half a step the hit-test is an exact
// tie and float noise picks the side (R88).
//
// **The `min` is a backstop, not the mechanism, and the gate proves it.** The
// approach clamp was killed in §28.5 because it bound on most taps — at which
// point it is not a guard, it is the mechanism wearing a guard's name. This
// one is the opposite: at the shipped pair (beeSize 44, cellSize 44) the body
// length is 30.07pt against a bound of 34.29, so the noun decides and the
// bound never binds. It only engages where a caller draws the bee large
// against the comb — `beeSize > 1.141 x cellSize` — and there the invariant
// matters more than the noun does. Rows 5c/5d sweep both halves of that: the
// bound holds for every pair, and the noun still decides at the shipped one.

// §28.3 — how far past HIM the pollen lands, as a fraction of the character's
// drawn WIDTH (Lumen 2026-08-25).
//
// **This used to be a fraction of the lattice step, and that is the bug.** One
// radius for all six flecks made the ×0.72 alternation below do two jobs at
// once — variety AND clearance — so the short flecks were, by arithmetic, the
// ones that failed. Measured off the shipped build: the 48-degree fleck never
// left the bee at all, and the 160-degree one cleared him by 0.54pt, less than
// its own radius. The rest of the burst happened underneath him.
//
// Each fleck now starts from ITS OWN direction's clearance (`MASCOT_CLEARANCE`,
// derived from the assets' alpha) and this gap is what it adds on top, so
// every fleck clears the drawing by construction at every angle and the
// alternation is free to be variety again.
//
// **Solved on the visible-clear currency, not on terminal position.** The
// earlier form of this rule bound the fleck's TERMINAL position, which is the
// frame its opacity reaches zero — satisfiable by a fleck no one ever sees
// outside him. The bound that binds: every fleck is clear of the drawing while
// at least HALF its seed opacity remains.
//
// That instant is exactly u = 0.5, and for a reason worth writing down rather
// than measuring: opacity runs `Animated.timing`'s default easing, which is
// `Easing.inOut(Easing.ease)` (`TimingAnimation.js:77`), and `inOut(f)(0.5)`
// is `1 - f(1)/2` — one half for ANY easing, since `f(1) = 1` is what makes it
// an easing. So the half-opacity instant does not depend on which curve
// opacity uses, only on it being an `inOut`.
//
// At u = 0.5 the drift (`Easing.out(Easing.cubic)`) has covered 0.875 of the
// distance and the dot has shrunk to 0.65 of its 3pt radius, so a fleck at
// radius r has its near edge at 0.875r - 1.95pt. Requiring that to clear the
// direction's own reach c:
//
//     gap * mult >= c / 7 + 2.2286pt        (at size 44)
//
// The binding fleck is the ×0.72 one firing into a leg: c = 19.363pt gives a
// floor of 6.9371pt, 0.2307 of the character width. 0.26 ships — 12.7% of
// headroom, because a constant set AT its floor breaches it the moment
// anything it is derived from moves.
//
// The ceiling is unchanged and is still the comb's: the far edge of the burst
// must stay inside the cell's own apothem, so it reads as landing ON the face
// rather than around it. At 0.26 the widest fleck lands 27.18pt out against an
// apothem of 38.105pt — 29% of headroom, where the old single-radius shapes
