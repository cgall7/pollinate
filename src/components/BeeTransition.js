// Per PLANS/HONEYCOMB_DESIGN.md §3 / §9.4: the bee arcs in and lifts off
// between claim screens, doing narrative work (stitching the argument
// together) rather than decorating. Scarcity rules: never idles, never
// loops, 2s cooldown between flights, reduced-motion collapses to a fade.
// Uses a glide spring (friction 9 / tension 60), not §4's pop spring —
// flight is traversal, not feedback, so a bounce reads wrong here. Pixel
// ratified this as the standard for all three Honeycomb bee moments too
// (gate R7, §9.4 amendment) — `path`/`anchorStyle`/`size` let each of those
// call sites tune the trajectory to its own geometry while sharing the same
// spring + scarcity engine as the claim-screen flights.

// §19.5 / R79: the bee here is `MascotBee`, the ratified render. The §17.3
// ruling this replaces picked `StripedBee` with `bandColor={accent}` so a bee
// crossing arbitrary content never knocked an opaque band out of it; a raster
// has no colour props, so that question retires. `flutter` is on for the live
// flight only; the reduced-motion fade stays a static pose, same as
// FlyingBee's parked path.
//
// **Facing.** The mascot has a face, so which way it points is now legible,
// and `SHARE_CARRY_PATH` travels 40pt to the *left* — a bee that has always
// flown that leg tail-first, invisibly, because the drawing it replaced had
// no expression to contradict it. Facing comes from `facingFor`, the same
// one-body-width rule the cruise rig uses, applied to this flight's net
// horizontal travel. It is constant for the whole flight — one stretch of
// travel has nothing to turn between — so there is no through-zero wheel
// here, only a mirror. The path's own bank is signed by it for R81's reason:
// scaleX is applied before rotate, so a mirrored bee rotated +θ tips its nose
// up, and these numbers were authored for the unmirrored drawing.
// Default size 20 → 32 — the claim arc crosses text, and 32 reads as a
// character without going cartoon (44 is the ambient cruiser's register).
